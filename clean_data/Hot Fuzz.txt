- Hello, Nicholas.
Hello, Sergeant.
- How's the hand?
Still a bit stiff.
It can get awfully hairy out there.
I'm surprised yÃ¶u weren't snapped up sooner for a nice desk job. That's what I did.
I prefer to think my office is out on the street.
Indeed, yÃ¶u do.
yÃ¶ur arrest record is 400% higher than any other officer.
Which is why it's high time that such skills were put to better use.
- We're making yÃ¶u Sergeant.
I see.
In Sandford, Gloucestershire.
- In where, sorry?
In Sandford, Gloucestershire.
- That's in the country.
Yes, lovely.
Isn't there a Sergeant's position here in London?
No.
- Can I remain here as a PC?
No.
- Do I have any choice in this?
No.
Sergeant, I kind of like it here.
Well, yÃ¶u've always wanted to transfer to the country.
- In 20 years or so, yes.
Well done, yÃ¶u.
Hang on, I don't remember telling yÃ¶u that.
Yes, yÃ¶u did. yÃ¶u said,
"I'd love to settle down in the country sometime, Janine."
I'd like to talk to the Inspector.
yÃ¶u can speak to the Inspector, but I can promise yÃ¶u
he will tell yÃ¶u exactly the same thing as I have.
- Hello, Nicholas. How's the hand?
It's still a bit stiff.
- And how are things at home?
I'm sorry, sir?
How's Janine?
We're no longer together, sir.
- Right. Then where are yÃ¶u living?
He's staying at the Section House, sir.
- With the recruits?
Yes, he's living out of cardboard boxes.
Well, then, yÃ¶u're packed already.
Nicholas, we're offering yÃ¶u a smashing position with a delightful cottage,
in a lovely little place that I think has won Village of the Year
I don't know how many times.
It'll be good for yÃ¶u.
- I don't really know what to say.
Yes?
Yes, thank yÃ¶u.
No, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to...
- yÃ¶u want to take this higher?
Yes, yes, I do.
yÃ¶u want me to bother the Chief Inspector with this?
Yes.
yÃ¶u want me to get the Chief Inspector to come all the way down here?
- Yes, I do.
Okay.
Kenneth!
- Hello, Nicholas. How's the hand?
Still a bit stiff.
- Chief Inspector...
Keep yÃ¶ur seat.
Now, I know what yÃ¶u're going to say,
but the fact is, yÃ¶u've been making us all look bad.
I'm sorry, sir?
Of course we all appreciate yÃ¶ur efforts,
but yÃ¶u've been rather letting the side down.
It's all about being a team player, Nicholas.
yÃ¶u can't be the Sheriff of London.
If we let yÃ¶u carry on running round town,
yÃ¶u'll continue to be exceptional and we can't have that.
yÃ¶u'll put us all out of a job.
With respect, sir.
- yÃ¶u can't just make people disappear.
Yes, I can. I'm the Chief Inspector.
Well, however yÃ¶u spin this, there's one thing yÃ¶u haven't taken into account.
And that's what the "team" is gonna make of this.
- Hello?
Janine, it's me.
I know. I'm at work.
I know, I'm outside.
What's the situation?
yÃ¶u know the situation.
We've been over this.
No, I... I meant here.
Two people involved, distinct signs of a struggle.
Complete mess.
- yÃ¶u are talking about here?
Nicholas, what do yÃ¶u want?
Well, I have something important to tell yÃ¶u and I didn't wanna do it over the phone.
Janine, I've been transferred.
I'm moving away for a while.
I'm not Janine.
Janine, I've been transferred.
I'm moving away for a while.
I know. Bob told me.
Hello, there.
Well, I wanted to tell yÃ¶u in person.
And there's no reason we can't be civil with each other.
It's not that long ago we were talking about getting married.
Yes, but yÃ¶u were already married to the force, weren't yÃ¶u?
We're actually supposed to call it
"the service" now.
Official vocab guidelines state that "force" is too aggressive.
See. It's only ever about the job.
- It's all yÃ¶u care about.
That's not true.
No, yÃ¶u're right, yÃ¶u do have that rubber plant.
- It's a Japanese Peace Lily.
yÃ¶u just can't switch off, Nicholas.
And until yÃ¶u find a person yÃ¶u care about more than yÃ¶ur job, yÃ¶u never will.
Besides, yÃ¶u were the one who suggested we take a break.
Yes, well, guilty people often make the first move.
Actually, there's something
I need to tell yÃ¶u.
- yÃ¶u're seeing someone else.
Yes. How did yÃ¶u...
- Is it Bob?
No.
Does Bob look like the kind of person I'd go out with?
It's Dave.
Hello, there.
I see.
Oh, Nicholas.
yÃ¶u do realize that window was broken from the inside?
Hello there, Nicholas,
Frank Butterman here, yÃ¶ur new Inspector.
I'm just calling with details of yÃ¶ur accommodation.
We've got yÃ¶u a lovely little cottage on Spencer Hill.
Look forward to meeting yÃ¶u anon. Cheerio.
Nicholas, Frank again.
One other thing about yÃ¶ur cottage.
It's not ready.
It would appear the heavens have opened.
- I was hoping to check in.
Check in?
But yÃ¶u've always been here.
- Excuse me?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought yÃ¶u were my husband.
- yÃ¶u must be Sergeant Angel.
Yes, I am.
I'm Joyce Cooper.
I trust yÃ¶u had a pleasant trip. Fascist.
I beg yÃ¶ur pardon?
"System of Government characterized by extreme dictatorship." Seven across.
- Oh, I see. It's "fascism."
Fascism. Wonderful.
Now, we've put yÃ¶u in the Castle Suite.
Bernard will escort yÃ¶u up there.
Well, actually,
I could probably make my own way up. Hag.
I beg yÃ¶ur pardon?
"Evil old woman considered frightful or ugly." It's 12 down.
Oh, bless yÃ¶u.
- Pint of lager, please, Mary.
Right yÃ¶u are, my love.
Yes, sir, what can I get yÃ¶u?
Could I have a glass of the cranberry juice, please?
Certainly.
Now, yÃ¶u wouldn't, by any chance, be the new policeman?
Police officer, yes. I'm Nicholas Angel.
- I'm Roy Porter. This is my wife Mary.
Mary.
Welcome to Sandford.
If there's anything yÃ¶u need, just let us know.
Thank yÃ¶u. Could I borrow yÃ¶ur newspaper?
It's not ours, love.
We're not big fans of the local fish wrapper, are we, Mare?
- They listed her age as 55.
When I'm actually 53.
Fifty-three.
- Pint of lager, please, Mary.
Right yÃ¶u are, my love.
- Excuse me.
What?
- When's yÃ¶ur birthday?
Twenty-second of February.
- What year?
Every year.
Get out.
- When's yÃ¶ur birthday?
Eighth of May, 1969.
- yÃ¶u're 37?
Yeah.
Get out.
When's yÃ¶ur birthday?
Out.
- Is there a problem, Officer?
Yes, there is, Mr. Porter.
It would appear a number of yÃ¶ur patrons are under age.
Well, a few of them may be a month or two south of proper.
But if they're in here, it stops them getting into trouble out there.
Yeah, the way we see it, it's all for the greater good.
The greater good.
Well, that's as may be, but the law's the law and they'll have to go.
- Another cranberry juice?
I'm fine, thank yÃ¶u.
I hope yÃ¶u're not planning on driving that.
No.
Right. I'm taking yÃ¶u to the station.
Where is it?
What?
Move.
"Nicholas Angel."
- Oh, when did yÃ¶u start?
Tomorrow.
Well, I see yÃ¶u've already arrested the whole village.
Not exactly.
- yÃ¶u in for the night?
Go on, four's free.
- Hey, now, I need to speak to him.
He'll be no use till the morning.
I see.
yÃ¶u really want to process all this lot?
- My pen's running out.
Not a problem.
- Morning, Sergeant.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning, Sergeant.
Morning, Sergeant.
- Lock me up.
I'm sorry?
I'm a slasher and I must be stopped.
- yÃ¶u're a what?
A slasher of prices.
Just kidding. I'm Simon Skinner.
I run the local supermarchÃ©.
Drop in and see me sometime.
My discounts are criminal.
Catch me later!
Morning, Sergeant.
Morning, Sergeant.
Could yÃ¶u tell the Inspector
I've arrived, please?
No.
Why?
He's not in yet.
- Well, how's our guest?
Guest?
- The inebriate in cell four.
I don't know. Nobody tells me nothing.
Can I get cell four open, please?
Danny, can yÃ¶u open four?
- He's gone.
Oh, my God. Who's gone?
- Why are yÃ¶u dressed like a police officer?
Because I am one.
Sergeant Angel, at last. Frank Butterman.
- I see yÃ¶u've already met my boy.
Yes.
Do forgive me.
I'm something of a Wild West nut.
Speaking of which, that was a fair few outlaws yÃ¶u rounded up last night.
Thank yÃ¶u, sir.
I admire yÃ¶ur enthusiasm and far be it from me to stifle yÃ¶ur flair,
but this isn't London.
Oh, yes, please, Danny.
With respect, sir,
geographical location shouldn't factor in the application of the law.
No, thanks.
Statistically, Sandford is the safest village in the country.
But that doesn't mean it requires anything less
than a careful and considered approach.
There's a reason we accommodate a few of the yÃ¶unglings at the pub.
- The greater good?
The greater good. Precisely.
yÃ¶ur predecessor assumed that rural policing was easy.
Ended up having a nervous breakdown.
And Sergeant Popwell was an exceptional officer, truly exceptional.
And he had one thing yÃ¶u haven't got.
- What's that, sir?
A great big bushy beard.
Come on, let's have a mosey around.
Locker room.
Riot room.
Evidence room.
Now, how about a trip to the Andes?
Detective Sergeant Wainwright and Detective Constable Cartwright.
Don't get up.
I expect yÃ¶u're wondering why we call them the Andes.
- They're both called Andrew?
They said yÃ¶u were good.
Also, because talking to them is an uphill struggle, isn't it, Dad?
- Fuck off!
Thank yÃ¶u, Danny.
And this is where it all happens.
That is Sergeant Tony Fisher.
PC Bob Walker.
And that is Saxon.
And this is one Doris Thatcher.
- She's our only policewoman.
She's not a policewoman.
- Yeah, she is. I've seen her bra.
She's a police officer.
Being a woman has nothing to do with it.
Oh, I don't know.
Comes in handy every so often.
I could've given yÃ¶u the tour.
I've been round the station a few times.
And what's upstairs?
Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.
Nicholas, this is Tom Weaver.
Civilian liaison with the Neighborhood Watch Alliance.
yÃ¶u'll find that we run a very tight ship here.
From this command center
I can see what the whole village is up to.
I must say I was rather admiring yÃ¶ur handiwork last night.
It's a pity yÃ¶u didn't do the same to those bloody hoodies.
Hanging around. Loitering. Sitting.
Actually, I did notice some minor graffiti on the fountain.
Graffiti? They've gotta be dealt with, Frank.
They're nippers, Tom. They'll come round.
Which reminds me,
our friend, The Living Statue, was here on Saturday.
11:00, 12:00, 1:00, 2:00.
If we don't come down hard on these clowns,
- we are gonna be up to our balls in jugglers.
We'll get right onto it, Tom.
We like to let them think they run the place.
Well, that's that.
Unless there's anything yÃ¶u're unclear about?
Yes, sir.
Why is everybody eating chocolate cake?
The Black Forest gateau is on Danny.
As punishment for his little indiscretion.
His...
Sir, I don't think driving under the influence can be called a "little indiscretion."
No, the gateau is for misplacing his helmet the other week.
Last night's incident will require something rather more serious.
- Good.
Do yÃ¶u like ice-cream?
I'm sorry, sir, I don't follow.
Let's just say that we won't be short of Chunky Monkey for the next month.
Dad.
Now, since it's yÃ¶ur first day and it's 11:30, I'd say that's lunch.
So, what made yÃ¶u choose Sandford then,
Sergeant Angel?
It wasn't actually my choice.
Oh, right, right, wasn't yÃ¶ur choice to come down here and tell me how to do my job.
Our jobs.
Yeah.
Look, I can assure yÃ¶u it wasn't my intention to upset the apple cart.
Yeah, 'cause we all sell apples round here, don't we?
- yÃ¶ur dad sells apples, Andy.
And raspberries.
I bet yÃ¶u can't wait to jump into Sergeant Popwell's grave.
I'm not jumping into anyone's grave.
- yÃ¶u got a mustache.
I know.
- Why have yÃ¶u got yÃ¶ur stab vest on?
It's a requirement.
In the city maybe.
Nobody's gonna stab yÃ¶u in here, Sergeant.
Not a member of the public anyhow.
- Have yÃ¶u been stabbed, Sergeant Fisher?
No.
Well, I have.
And I can assure yÃ¶u it is not in the least bit amusing.
Have yÃ¶u seen a lot of action,
Sergeant Angel?
I've experienced my fair share, yes.
- Did yÃ¶u cook any fools?
Excuse me?
Did yÃ¶u shoot anybody?
He shot a crack head with a Kalashnikov.
- Where did yÃ¶u get that?
The offender had the Kalashnikov.
Where'd he get that?
yÃ¶u do know there are more guns in the country than there are in the city?
Everybody and their mums is packing round here.
- Like who?
Farmers.
- Who else?
Farmers's mums.
What's it like being stabbed?
It was the single most painful experience of my life.
What was the second most painful?
yÃ¶u ever fired two guns whilst jumping through the air?
No.
yÃ¶u ever fired one gun whilst jumping through the air?
No.
- Ever been in a high speed pursuit?
Yes, I have.
yÃ¶u ever fired a gun whilst in a high speed pursuit?
No.
Annette, that Sergeant Angel's coming into yÃ¶ur shop.
Get a look at his arse.
- What about Lethal Weapon?
No.
- yÃ¶u've seen Die Hard, though?
No.
- Bad Boys II?
No.
yÃ¶u ain't seen Bad Boys II?
- Hell of a day, huh?
Yeah.
- Same again tomorrow?
Yeah.
Amanda Paver, headmistress of Sandford Primary.
How do yÃ¶u do, Sergeant?
- Simon Skinner, I believe yÃ¶u've met.
Oh, we're already firm friends.
Oh, please, please, come with me, will yÃ¶u?
This is Leslie Tiller,
whose horticultural expertise has helped put Sandford on the map.
- She's ever so good.
Oh, go on.
This is James Reaper, who owns Brannigan Farm.
I hear yÃ¶u're quite the marksman.
Perhaps yÃ¶u might like to join us for a shoot one day.
Well, I haven't held a firearm for over two years, Mr. Reaper.
I'd quite like to keep it that way.
yÃ¶u will be popular with the local birds.
Birds.
Nicholas, hello. Reverend Shooter.
I want to ask yÃ¶u, would yÃ¶u read a homily at Sunday Service?
That might be a little hypocritical of me, Reverend.
Oh, yÃ¶u're an atheist?
No, I'm... I'm...
I'm open to the concept of religion,
I'm just not entirely convinced by it.
- yÃ¶u're an agnostic?
I think I have a cream for that.
Robin Hatcher, our resident sawbones.
Hopefully we won't see too much of each other over the coming months.
Well, all that remains is to welcome yÃ¶u
to the weekly meeting of the Neighborhood Watch Alliance.
Now, quick announcement before we begin.
Janet Barker has just given birth to twins.
So, congratulations to her.
- Tom?
Thanks, Joyce.
Now.
I am sure that all of yÃ¶u will have noticed the return of a blight to our streets.
It's made all the more disturbing as the Village of the Year contest looms.
I refer, of course, to the extremely irritating Living Statue.
Police work is as much about preventing crime
as it is about fighting crime.
Most importantly, it is about procedural correctness
in the execution of unquestionable moral authority.
Any questions?
Yes.
Is it true that there is a place in a man's head
that if yÃ¶u shoot it, it will blow up?
Hi, hi, Tim Messenger.
Can I get a quick shot for the Sandford Citizen?
Okay.
How about yÃ¶u put the teacher in handcuffs?
I don't think that gives off the right signals.
Too cheesy-pie. Okay. Gotcha.
- Give the little blonde kid yÃ¶ur hat.
I'd rather not.
- Wave yÃ¶ur hitting stick about.
No.
Righty-ho-ho.
Oh, can I have yÃ¶ur autograph, please?
- For the breakfast.
Oh, sorry.
Hey, that weren't me.
- Morning, Angle.
Good morning, Angle.
- Morning, Angle.
Morning, Angle.
- Sergeant Angel.
Morning. The swan's escaped.
- The swan's escaped?
Yeah.
Right. And where has the swan escaped from exactly?
- The castle.
Oh, yeah? And who might yÃ¶u be?
Mr. Staker. Yeah, Mr. Peter Ian Staker.
P.I. Staker. Right. Piss taker. Come on!
Yes, Mr. Staker. We'll do everything we can.
Can yÃ¶u describe it to me?
It's about two foot tall.
- Long slender neck.
Yeah.
- Kind of orange and black bill.
Anything else?
Well, it's a swan.
That's just gonna scare it.
- No luck catching them swans then?
It's just the one swan, actually.
- Want anything from the shop?
yÃ¶u've just been to the shop.
I was thinking of a different shop.
Constable Butterman, this is not the time for personal errands.
- Well, there's nothing going on, is there?
There is always something going on.
yÃ¶u have to look closer, all right?
What about this guy?
- Mr. Treacher?
Yeah.
Why has he got that big coat on?
He can't be cold. Why the extra layer?
Maybe he's trying to hide something.
Mr. Treacher?
Okay. What about this guy?
Ask yÃ¶urself, why has he got his hat pulled down like that?
- He's fuck ugly.
Or he doesn't want yÃ¶u to see his face.
Because he's fuck ugly.
Okay, what's his story?
- Oh, that's Lurch.
Go on.
- He's a trolley boy at the local supermarket.
Good.
Real name, Michael Armstrong.
- Dad says he's got a child's mind.
Okay.
And lives up Summer Street with his mum and his sister.
And are they as big as he is?
- Who?
The mum and the sister.
Same person.
What shop were yÃ¶u thinking of?
Sergeant Angel to the Manager's office.
Manager's office. Sergeant Angel.
Sergeant Angel. Or is it Angle?
Mr. Skinner, a baby's sicked up in aisle six.
Please excuse me. Michael!
Yarp.
- Child vomit. Aisle six. Mop it up.
Yarp.
- Mr. Skinner, is there a problem?
No, no, no, no.
I simply wanted to say how lovely it is to see yÃ¶u supporting yÃ¶ur local store.
Well, that's quite all right.
All too many have defected to the big Megamart in Buford Abbey.
May their heads be struck from their shoulders for such disloyalty.
Yes, well, I am on duty, so if yÃ¶u'll excuse me.
Of course. I simply spied yÃ¶u loitering in organic produce
and assumed yÃ¶u had time on yÃ¶ur hands.
Well, maybe I'm not the one yÃ¶u should be keeping an eye on.
That's the Fridge Magnate.
His name's George Merchant.
Made a fortune in kitchen goods.
Built that monstrosity on Norris Avenue.
Actually, I wasn't talking about him.
I was talking about him.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
"Meet the cop that can't be stopped."
Tosser!
Trouble in the high street.
Sergeant Angel's having a spot of bother.
Roger that.
Morning, Sergeant.
yÃ¶u mothers.
- Let's cut through here. Head him off.
Through the gardens?
What's the matter, Danny? yÃ¶u never taken a shortcut before.
Hey, give me that!
"yÃ¶u do not have to say anything, however it may harm yÃ¶ur defense
"if yÃ¶u fail to mention when questioned something yÃ¶u later rely on in court.
"Anything yÃ¶u do say can be given in evidence."
- Hi, Danny.
All right, Pete?
Do yÃ¶u know this man?
Yeah, he's Auntie Jackie's sister's brother's boy.
And it didn't occur to yÃ¶u to mention this before?
Couldn't see his face, could I?
I'm not made of eyes.
Impressive collar.
Shame Mr. Skinner doesn't want to press charges.
What do yÃ¶u mean, he doesn't wanna press charges?
I'm simply suggesting that, yÃ¶u know,
Peter be given a second chance
before he becomes just another crime statistic.
I'm sure he's going to learn a valuable lesson.
- Stealing biscuits is wrong?
Correct.
Thanks.
And yet we respond by not taking a single punitive measure?
Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles.
Like the biscuits, isn't it?
- Mr. Skinner...
Is everything all right?
Well, sir, Mr. Skinner feels it would be better not to prosecute an individual
that has committed a blatant offense.
Leave this with me.
I'll make sure everyone gets their just deserts.
Oh, no!
Twenty-seven.
- Have yÃ¶u ever seen Point Break?
No.
Amazing bit in Point Break where they jump over fences.
Is there now? Twenty-nine.
Patrick Swayze's just robbed this bank and Keanu Reeves is chasing him
through people's gardens, and he goes to shoot Swayze but he can't,
'cause he loves him so much,
and he's firing his gun up in the air, he's like...
Forty.
Have yÃ¶u ever fired yÃ¶ur gun up in the air and gone...
No, I have not ever fired my gun up in the air and gone...
Thirty.
Sorry, I... I just...
I just feel like I'm missing out sometimes.
- I wanna do what yÃ¶u do.
yÃ¶u do, do what I do.
What on earth do yÃ¶u think yÃ¶u're missing out on?
Gun fights. Car chases.
Proper action and shit.
Police work is not about proper action or shit.
Twenty-nine.
If yÃ¶u had paid attention to me in school,
yÃ¶u'd understand that it's not all about gun fights and car chases.
Fire up the roof.
That was brilliant.
Was I going a tad fast, Officer?
Yes, yÃ¶u were, Mr. Blower.
Well, now, yÃ¶u see, we are staging a homage
to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and I'm a little late for the dress rehearsal.
I'm playing the eponymous hero, yÃ¶u see.
Romeo not Juliet.
- What are yÃ¶u writing?
Everything yÃ¶u're saying.
I might need to refer to it later.
Now, Officer, I am a respected solicitor so there's no need to...
Just stop writing, will yÃ¶u?
Look, I'm merely trying to explain why I might have exceeded the speed limit.
yÃ¶u're playing the male lead in a homage to William Shakespeare's
Romeo and Juliet and yÃ¶u're late for the dress rehearsal.
yÃ¶u think this is sufficient reason to travel at 48 in a 30 zone?
- Well, I...
To flout speed limits
- specifically put in place to save lives.
Just, look, this is preposterous.
- "Preposterous."
Look, just stop writing!
"Stop writing."
Look, yÃ¶u're right, I apologize.
- See what I did there?
yÃ¶u hypnotized him.
No, I used this.
This is the most important piece of equipment yÃ¶u will ever own.
This notebook has saved my skin more times than I care to mention.
yÃ¶u should think about using yÃ¶urs more often.
- I do use mine.
Show me.
- That's just extraordinary.
yÃ¶u should see the one on the other side.
- What are yÃ¶u up to tonight?
I have to water my Peace Lily.
Thought yÃ¶u might wanna do something.
- What exactly were yÃ¶u thinking?
Don't know. Pub?
I don't think that's a good idea. Do yÃ¶u?
yÃ¶u two.
A Mr. Blower left yÃ¶u tickets for Romeo and Juliet tonight.
Said it was by way of an apology.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Well, we can't accept gifts from somebody we've officially rebuked. So...
Yeah.
Nicholas. Glad I caught yÃ¶u.
Wondered if yÃ¶u wouldn't mind representing us at the am drams tonight.
- Yes, sir, of course.
And there's a spare for Danny, too.
Yeah! Hey, come on, it might be fun.
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.
Here's to my love.
Now.
Poison? I'll kiss thy lips.
Happily some poison doth yet hang on them.
Bang!
Sergeant Angel, hi-hi.
Quick word for the Sandford Citizen.
It was very enjoyable.
- "Cop Enjoys Watching yÃ¶ung Lovers"?
I don't think so.
"Local Bobby Gives Thumbs Up
To Teen Suicide"?
That's just grossly inappropriate.
yÃ¶u will try and spell his name correctly this time, won't yÃ¶u, Timothy?
Absolute tosh, wasn't it?
And annoyingly, the understudies are actually professional actors.
Greg over there was an extra in Straw Dogs
and Sheree portrayed a cadaver in Prime Suspect.
Sergeant Angel, yÃ¶u came?
So thrilled yÃ¶u accepted my invitation.
Well, our Inspector requested we attend. So...
Yeah, we can't accept gifts from someone we've officially rebuked so...
Jog on.
Congratulations to yÃ¶u and to Mrs. Blower.
Oh, this is not my wife.
This is Miss Draper. My leading lady.
Eve works in the local council, Sergeant.
Quite the lady in the know.
- I am not.
Nonsense.
I'm sure if we bashed yÃ¶ur head in, all sorts of secrets would come tumbling out.
Romeo, Romeo, a pint of bitter for Romeo?
Thank yÃ¶u very much for coming, George.
Excuse us.
A pleasure, my liege.
- Eve's nice, ain't she?
She certainly has a distinctive laugh.
She was in my year at school.
Always had a thing for her.
She clearly has a thing for older men.
What, with Martin Blower? No way!
We just sat through three hours of so-called acting, Constable,
their kiss was the only convincing moment in it.
Hey, now yÃ¶u come to mention it,
I too have reason to believe she favors the older gent.
Really? How so?
Marcus Carter's big brother said he'd fingered her up the duck pond.
Oh, Officers.
Again let me extend my sincere apologies for earlier.
That's quite all right, Mr. Blower. Drive safe.
"Drive safe." Oh, my God.
yÃ¶u know that's the bloke we done for speeding earlier.
Yeah. Hopefully, that's the last we'll see of him.
Who is it?
We haven't got long.
To us.
Who is it?
Yeah?
- ...decaffeinated?
Decaffeinated?
Little Brian Libby found them, out on his paper round.
Oh, he'll be having nightmares for a while.
Must have hit the sign at some speed.
Took the whole top off.
- I've had my top off in this lay-by.
Tits.
Most likely lost control, left the road there and then ended up here.
So, what do we reckon?
Sergeant Angel?
Well, we should get a proper cordon off, screen the remains from public view.
Close down the road until the ambulance crew arrives,
whereupon we should open a single lane of traffic and ease congestion.
Very good.
What he said.
- What happened, Danny?
Car accident.
Nasty way to go.
Constable, official vocab guidelines state
we no longer refer to these incidents as "accidents," they're now "collisions."
Right.
"For never was there a story of more woe.
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."
- Excuse me?
Martin and Eve. Such a tragedy.
Mr. Skinner, do yÃ¶u mind telling me
how yÃ¶u know the identity of the persons involved?
yÃ¶u know how it is. News travels fast.
A love struck Romeo sings a streetsus serenade
- What happened, Danny?
Traffic collision.
Hey, why can't we say "accident" again?
Because "accident" implies there's nobody to blame.
Put a sock in it, town mouse.
Yeah, yÃ¶u wanna be a big cop in a small town, fuck off up the model village.
I'm just saying, things aren't always as simple as they look.
Most times they are.
Let's just wait till Doctor Hatcher comes back with something,
before yÃ¶u go jumping the Kalashnikov.
All right, in the meantime, why don't yÃ¶u check out a few of Martin Blower's clients?
Martin Blower represents damn near most of the village.
Did yÃ¶u want us to go through the whole phone book?
Yeah, or put a call into Aaron A. Aaronson, shall we?
Please, don't be childish.
At least consider interviewing the widow.
Martin Blower was clearly having an affair with Eve Draper.
Oh, and how did yÃ¶u establish that?
'Cause we sat through three hours of so-called acting last night,
and the kiss was the only convincing moment in it.
All right, pipe down, big one.
Here, what else yÃ¶u got,
Crockett and Tubby?
- Skid marks.
Now who's being childish?
There were no skid marks at the scene.
Doesn't it seem a little strange that
Martin Blower would lose control of his car
and not think to apply the brakes?
If there were no skid marks it follows
that for 300 yards both driver and passenger did nothing to prevent their fate.
yÃ¶u don't have to be a detective to work that out!
Yeah.
- Are yÃ¶u causing trouble?
Yes, they are.
Well, a spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.
Old Arthur Webley's been clipping hedgerows that don't belong to him.
- Yes, sir?
That's it.
Yes, sir.
- Why do we need the dog?
It's not the dog we need.
Right.
What did he say?
- What did he say?
He said, "An 'edge is an 'edge.
"He only chopped it down
'cause it spoilt his view.
"What's Reaper moaning about?"
Right.
Look, I appreciate yÃ¶ur position,
Mr. Webley,
but yÃ¶u can't go around chopping down other people's hedges without permission.
"Yes, I suppose."
Thank yÃ¶u.
All right.
Mr. Webley,
I trust yÃ¶u have a license for that firearm?
He does for this one.
What do yÃ¶u mean by "this one"?
By the power of Grey Skull.
Where on earth did yÃ¶u get these?
- Found them.
He found them!
- And what is this?
Sea mine.
Sea mine.
Well, Mr. Webley, this is an extremely dangerous collection.
It's a wonder nobody's been hurt before.
No, it's just a lot of junk.
Move, move, move!
- yÃ¶u what?
No, apparently it's been deactivated. Over.
That's right, deactivated!
- It's not live.
It looks live.
All right.
That was quite an impressive haul today,
Constable Butterman.
Well, yÃ¶u know, I mean, maybe we should do something to celebrate.
Unless yÃ¶u gotta water yÃ¶ur Peace Lily.
- What exactly did yÃ¶u have in mind?
I don't know. Pub?
Right yÃ¶u are, my love.
Yes, sirs, what can I get yÃ¶u?
Pint of lager, please, Roy.
And what can I get yÃ¶u that isn't a cranberry juice?
- I don't really wanna get drunk.
yÃ¶u can get a little drunk.
- Okay, I'll have one.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
Mr. Porter, what's yÃ¶ur wine selection?
Oh, we got red or white.
- I'll have a pint of lager, please.
Yeah, Roy.
- Any news from earlier?
Yeah. CSI found nothing.
Doctor Hatcher reported no misadventure and Mrs. Blower has four alibis.
Now, come on, Sergeant, it's not yÃ¶ur job to investigate this incident, is it?
Is it?
- No, it isn't.
No, it isn't.
- yÃ¶u don't switch off, do yÃ¶u?
yÃ¶u sound like my ex.
- Well, yÃ¶u are always thinking away.
It's what I do.
- Don't get me wrong. I think it's amazing.
Really?
I mean, what made yÃ¶u wanna be a policeman?
Officer.
What made yÃ¶u wanna be a policeman-officer?
I don't remember a time when I didn't wanna be a police officer.
Apart from the summer of 1979 when I wanted to be Kermit the Frog.
It all started with my Uncle Derek.
He was a Sergeant in the Met.
He bought me a police pedal car when I was five.
I rode round in it every second I was awake.
Arresting kids twice my size for littering and spitting.
I got beaten up a lot when I was yÃ¶ung but it didn't stop me.
I wanted to be like Uncle Derek.
He sounds like a good bloke.
Actually, he was arrested for selling drugs to students.
What a cunt.
Probably bought the pedal car with the proceeds.
Needless to say I never went near it again.
I just let it rust.
But I never forgot the clear sense of right and wrong
that I felt at the wheel of that pedal car.
I had to prove to myself that the law could be proper
and righteous and for the good of humankind.
It was from that moment,
I was destined to be a police officer.
- Shame.
How so?
I think yÃ¶u would've made a great muppet.
What about yÃ¶u? What made yÃ¶u wanna become a police officer?
I don't know. Dad does it.
I think after my mum died, it's what he wanted, yÃ¶u know, keep me close by.
- Do yÃ¶u mind if I ask how she died?
Traffic collision.
I'm sorry.
Never mind. Hey, watch this.
- Jesus Christ!
Oh, my eye!
Ta-da!
Hey, come on, silly bollocks, get them in.
- 777.
Mr. Skinner.
- yÃ¶u know George Merchant, don't yÃ¶u?
Evening, Officer.
Yes, we were just discussing the accident.
I'd come to know Martin and Eve very well of late.
Such a loss.
What say we drink to their demise?
Shouldn't that be "drink to their memories"?
Of course. Cheers.
I must go to the little boys' room.
- I'm all right!
"Little" being the operative word.
Oh, he'll be in bits tomorrow.
I think somebody needs to go home.
- I'm... I'm not that drunk, sir.
Not yÃ¶u. Him.
What?
Hey, we did get a little drunk.
Did yÃ¶u get it?
'Cause he's... He's little and he's drunk.
Oh, good grief.
It's hardly in keeping with the village's rustic esthetic, is it?
- How much do I owe yÃ¶u?
Twenty quid.
There yÃ¶u go.
- And there's yÃ¶ur change.
God bless yÃ¶u.
Bye-bye.
I'm all right.
I would not wanna be him in the morning.
Well, this is me.
Well, I shall see yÃ¶u in the morning.
Unless yÃ¶u wanna come in for a cup of coffee?
- I don't drink coffee.
Tea?
No caffeine after midday.
How about another beer?
Oh, dear.
- When did yÃ¶u move in?
About five years ago.
- yÃ¶u should get some house plants.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. I've been tending my Peace Lily for about three years now.
It oxygenates the room, helps yÃ¶u think, relieves stress.
Its needs are simple.
Janine used to say I love my Lily more than I loved her.
- Is that why yÃ¶u split up?
What?
- 'Cause yÃ¶u did it with a plant?
No, no, no.
It was more about me being obsessed with the job.
That's good though, right?
Is it though?
I did miss a few dinners. yÃ¶u know, parties, a birthday or two.
- Listen, mate, I...
Her dad's funeral.
- I just wanna be good at what I do.
yÃ¶u are good at what yÃ¶u do.
yÃ¶u've just gotta learn to switch off that big old melon of yÃ¶urs.
That's the whole problem, Danny.
I don't think I know how.
I can show yÃ¶u how.
By the power of Grey Skull.
Point Break or Bad Boys II?
Which one do yÃ¶u think I'll prefer?
No, I mean which one do yÃ¶u wanna watch first?
yÃ¶u are pulling my leg?
What did yÃ¶u think of that?
Well, I won't argue that it was a no holds barred,
adrenalin fueled thrill ride but there's no way yÃ¶u could perpetrate
that amount of carnage and mayhem and not incur a considerable amount of paperwork.
That is nothing, man.
This is about to go off.
This shit just got real.
Nasty way to go.
I think our Mr. Merchant tried to have a little fry up and left the gas on.
Spends his whole life devoted to the refrigerator
then gets killed by an oven.
I told him several times, yÃ¶u shouldn't eat late at night.
Oh, I don't know.
I quite like a little midnight gobble.
Cocks.
So, what do we reckon? Angel?
Help me.
Okay, we get a proper cordon up, we let the fire crews finish their stuff,
and then we get forensics in to do a thorough sweep of the house.
Very good. What he said.
Sergeant Angel, hi-hi. A quick word?
Mr. Messenger, a statement will be issued shortly.
Actually, I just wanted to ask,
"What's yÃ¶ur perfect Sunday?"
I'll deal with the press, Sergeant.
Now, my perfect Sunday is a lovely long lie in...
Fire to destroy all yÃ¶u've done
Like in the films.
Something like, something out of Backdraft.
- What are yÃ¶u thinking? Foul play?
Maybe.
We're just hoping to talk to the last people to see Mr. Merchant alive.
Namely a Sergeant Knickerless Asswipe and a Constable Fanny Batterbum.
- That's us.
Why is this such a big joke to yÃ¶u?
Three people have died in a week.
Oh, come on, Doctor Sherlock, they were accidents.
People have accidents every day.
- The victims knew each other.
Everyone knows everyone round here.
Yeah. If yÃ¶u didn't see anything suspicious, then who did?
It's a bit of a blind spot, I'm afraid.
We just catch the very edge of the explosion.
Nasty way to go.
- There was something took my eye.
Really? What's that?
Sandford's most wanted.
There yÃ¶u go. It was the swan all along.
- This is not funny, Detective!
Oh, give over, Miss Marples.
Yeah, yÃ¶u do yÃ¶ur job and we'll do ours, eh?
Yeah. Haven't yÃ¶u got a church fete to look after?
No, I have not!
Actually.
Testing. Testing.
Someone's in for a surprise at 3:00, ladies and gentlemen.
It's the raffle with a very special guest presenter.
Out in the country
Far from all the sorts of noise of the city
There's a village green
It's been a long time since I last set eyes
On the church with a steeple
That's me after a couple of pints.
Splat the rat.
Splat the rat.
Splat the rat.
Shark!
Seen any murderings, Nicholarse?
Come on, boys.
Leave Sergeant Angel alone, he's working.
Sorry, Chief, won't waste any more police time.
Have a nice time.
Actually, Nicholas, yÃ¶u might as well take a break.
Hey, great. I've got something to show yÃ¶u.
- This is a rifle range.
yÃ¶u'll be really good at it.
Feeling lucky, Sergeant?
Three cans wins yÃ¶u the squeaky bunny, five cans gets yÃ¶u the floppy lion.
Take out all the little people, yÃ¶u get to waltz off with the cuddly monkey.
I thought I made it clear to yÃ¶u how I feel about firearms.
It's only an air rifle.
Sergeant.
Dear Lord!
That was amazing.
- Thank yÃ¶u, Danny.
I can't believe I shot someone.
- He's a doctor, he can deal with it.
I never shot anyone before.
Danny, believe me, it's not something yÃ¶u ever get used to.
Yeah. Maybe we should go on the bouncy castle.
Take our minds off of it.
- Sergeant Angel, hi-hi.
Mr. Messenger.
I need to talk to yÃ¶u about George Merchant. Alone.
Churchyard. 3:00.
What do yÃ¶u think he wants?
Would
Sergeant Angel come to the stage, please?
Here to announce the winners is the newest addition to the Sandford Police Force.
Service.
Sergeant Nicholas Angel.
- Prick.
Wanker.
Hello. Hello.
The first name is Simon Skinner.
He's in the loo.
Too much of Joyce's lemonade, perhaps.
And the next name is...
Tim, yÃ¶ur number's up.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hi-hi.
Oh, no!
Stand back, stand back!
There's been a terrible accident.
- Accident?
Just an accident.
It's all right, it's all right.
There's nothing to see.
Come on, everybody. It's all right.
It's just an accident.
Nicholas, what is it?
Sir, I think all these deaths are linked.
I think Tim Messenger was murdered.
- Who could do something like this?
Maybe it was the swan.
- Apparently, they can break a man's arm.
Or blow up a man's house.
- Listen, yÃ¶u pair of...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Nicholas.
Now, let me get this straight.
- Are yÃ¶u saying that this is a crime scene?
Yes, sir, I am.
Very well.
- Detectives.
Sir.
Start interviewing everyone who was at the fete.
Oh, he's got shorts on.
- Sergeant Fisher?
What?
- Secure the area.
What?
- PC Thatcher?
Yes, love?
Get the CSI down here.
PC Walker?
Patrol the churchyard with Saxon.
Nicholas, Danny, yÃ¶u know what to do.
Do yÃ¶u really think this is murder?
I just don't think we should rule it out, that's all.
Yeah. I think yÃ¶u're right.
I think yÃ¶u're talking a load of old shit.
He thinks yÃ¶u're talking a load of shit.
Swings and roundabouts, isn't it?
Pain in the arse.
- Did yÃ¶u find anything?
Yeah.
I was extremely shocked when I looked at my watch
and discovered that I should be in the pub.
Did yÃ¶u go to his house?
Did yÃ¶u read his articles?
If yÃ¶u wanna wade through every copy of the Sandford bloody Citizen, be our guest.
It's yÃ¶ur job, isn't it? Detect!
This ain't the city, Mr. Angel.
Not everyone's a murdering psychopath.
It's high time yÃ¶u realized that. yÃ¶u and yÃ¶ur monkey.
Did he mean me or that?
Oh, maybe we should go home.
- What do yÃ¶u mean?
Well, there's nothing going on, is there?
Have yÃ¶u listened to anything that I've said?
What do yÃ¶u mean?
Is anything I've told yÃ¶u in the last two weeks
- sunk into that thick skull of yÃ¶urs?
Yeah.
Has it? Like what?
yÃ¶u said I could be an amazing policeman-officer.
There's always something going on, Danny.
And yÃ¶u won't be an amazing police officer until yÃ¶u understand that.
Well, I remembered something else yÃ¶u said and all.
- Oh, did yÃ¶u now?
Yeah.
yÃ¶u don't know how to switch off!
Well, if yÃ¶u wanna wade through every copy
of the Sandford bloody Citizen, be our guest.
- Morning, Constable.
All right?
Thanks for the monkey.
- yÃ¶urs, isn't it?
I won it for yÃ¶u.
Danny, I think I'm on to something.
- Are yÃ¶u?
Yes.
And I think with a little deliberation we can figure out what links these deaths.
- We?
Come on, partner. Let's go to work.
Oh, oh, Sergeant Angel?
- Someone from London called for yÃ¶u.
Tell them I'll call them back.
- Tim Messenger.
Go.
Editor and journalist at The Sandford Citizen.
- Fondness for puns.
Go on.
- Terrible speller.
Oh, yeah?
Nevertheless had uncovered important information about...
- George Merchant.
Self-made millionaire.
Fancied himself as a property developer.
- Said he had big plans for Sandford.
Pissed on the floor in The Crown.
But more importantly, was a good friend and client of...
- Martin Blower.
Respected solicitor.
- Affirmatron.
Leading light of the local drama society.
- Bad actor.
Undoubtedly.
- Bad driver.
Not necessarily.
- Cheated on his missus.
Most certainly.
- And we both know who with.
Eve Draper.
- Blower's leading lady. Distinctive laugh.
True.
- Favored older men.
Fingered.
- Worked at?
Council.
- More specifically?
Department of Planning and Development.
Where George Merchant secured permission
to build his dubious mansion on Norris Avenue.
So...
Maybe they were all accidents.
People have accidents every day.
- What are yÃ¶u two up to?
Nothing.
Well, look sharp.
- There's been reports of a fire in the station.
What?
Happy birthday to yÃ¶u
Happy birthday to yÃ¶u
- Danny, why didn't yÃ¶u say something?
We were working, weren't we?
- Hey, where are yÃ¶u going?
Personal errand.
Hello, Miss Tiller.
I was wondering, do yÃ¶u have any Japanese Peace Lilies?
Of course.
I was just about to pop off, actually.
I can never find my scissors.
- Is this for someone special?
Yes. Yes, it is.
- Are yÃ¶u going somewhere, Miss Tiller?
Yes. I'm moving away.
And why the move, if yÃ¶u don't mind me asking?
- Well, just between yÃ¶u and I...
Yes?
- yÃ¶u know that fella who blew up?
George Merchant.
Well, George Merchant, God rest him, wanted to buy this land,
so he sends round his legal fella,
Martin Blower, God rest him,
and I thought I might take them up on it.
I haven't really got that much family round here, save for Cousin Sissy.
So I thought I might take them up on the offer and move to Buford Abbey.
Would yÃ¶u like a card with this?
No, sorry, yÃ¶u were talking about the offer?
Well, it turns out that Martin Blower,
God rest him,
knew where the new bypass road is going
because he was knocking off Eve Draper from the council, God rest her,
and then that reporter, God rest him, finds out about the route
and tells me this land's very valuable.
Ten times what George Merchant and
Martin Blower, God rest them, offered me.
So, with them having passed on,
I decided to sell it on myself
to some folks from the city that Martin, George and Eve,
God rest the lot of them, had been talking to.
Apparently, they want to build a big shopping center or something.
Of course, Cousin Sissy won't be too happy about that,
but as far as I'm concerned,
Cousin Sissy can go and fuck...
Would yÃ¶u just excuse me, for just one second?
Stop!
In the name of the law!
Hang about, hang about.
yÃ¶u're saying this wasn't an accident?
Leslie Tiller was fucking murdered!
- What, just like Tim Messenger?
Yes!
- And George Merchant?
Yes!
- And Eve Draper?
Yes!
- And Martin Blower?
No, actually.
- Really?
'Course he fucking was!
Thank yÃ¶u, Danny.
Oh, murder, murder, murder.
Change the fucking record.
Thank yÃ¶u, Andy.
Come on, Sergeant, yÃ¶u've gotta accept it was just another nasty accident.
What are yÃ¶u suggesting?
That Leslie Tiller tripped and fell on her own shears?
Ben Fletcher fell on his pitchfork the other week.
Yeah, accidents happen all the time.
What makes yÃ¶u think it was murder?
- Because I was there!
There's a point.
Why were yÃ¶u there?
I was buying Constable Butterman a Japanese Peace Lily for his birthday.
What absolute horseshit.
I chased a suspect from the scene.
Innocent people don't run!
Here, maybe it was our old friend, the cactus thief.
Oh, yeah, he was a prickly customer, weren't he?
Am I going completely mad?
Maybe yÃ¶u are.
Maybe yÃ¶u did it.
Yeah, seeing as how yÃ¶u're such a big fan of murder.
- What the...
Sergeant Angel?
Yes! Sir.
Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas.
What am I going to do with yÃ¶u?
- Sir, yÃ¶u have to understand...
No, yÃ¶u have to understand.
The boys here aren't used to the concepts yÃ¶u're bandying about.
The "M" word, Nicholas.
There hasn't been a recorded murder in Sandford for 20 years.
But, sir, I'm certain.
And what's more, I know who did it.
Can I see the manager, please?
Mr. Skinner to the Manager's office.
Manager's office. Mr. Skinner.
Sergeant Angel.
And to what do I owe this pleasure?
Simon Skinner, I'm arresting yÃ¶u on suspicion of the murder of Leslie Tiller.
Leslie Tiller's dead? How?
She tripped and fell on her own shears.
I'm also arresting yÃ¶u on suspicion of the murder of Tim Messenger on May 1st,
of George Merchant on April 29th
and of Eve Draper and Martin Blower on April 28th.
- Why on earth would I do that, Sergeant?
I'm glad yÃ¶u asked.
My suspicions were first aroused when yÃ¶u appeared
at the scene of the Blower-Draper death, on the outskirts of Sandford,
despite the fact yÃ¶u live and work in the center of the village.
I couldn't help but recall yÃ¶ur comments at the theater on the previous evening.
When yÃ¶u not only indicated an awareness of the couple's affair
but also inferred that Eve's connections at the council
might make her privy to important information.
yÃ¶u even spoke of "bashing her head in."
Perhaps hoping yÃ¶u might discover the route of the proposed Sandford Bypass.
yÃ¶u were already suspicious that George Merchant was buying up
a large area of land on the outskirts of Sandford,
after an article Tim Messenger wrote in the Sandford Citizen.
yÃ¶u see, the land Merchant was buying had little value in of itself but,
if it became accessible by road, it would be a prime location for say,
a retail park.
Consumed with concern for yÃ¶ur business
and potential disloyalty from fickle customers,
yÃ¶u yÃ¶urself expressed a wish to behead.
yÃ¶u killed the competition in cold blood.
Staging the murders as accidents.
yÃ¶u used a vehicle removal truck to stage the Blower-Draper death
and incinerated an old man in his own house.
Covering yÃ¶ur tracks with the judicial application of bacon and beans.
However, there was a loose end.
Tim Messenger.
Splattered before he could share with me
what he told Leslie Tiller that very afternoon.
The true value of her land.
Upon discovering she was about to sell up to the developers,
yÃ¶u brutally murdered her with her own shears.
And made good yÃ¶ur escape utilizing yÃ¶ur impressive skills as a fun runner.
Very entertaining. But I rather think yÃ¶u've been watching too many films.
He hasn't.
Why would I kill Leslie? yÃ¶u clearly aren't aware that we're related.
Oh, but I am, "Cousin Sissy."
I'm afraid my nickname of Sissy is only a revelation to yÃ¶urself.
My teenage years studying ballet are well known.
- Yeah, Sissy Skinner.
What a Gaylord.
Thank yÃ¶u, Andrews.
Now, despite my comments about "beheading" customers,
I personally relish the competition of another store.
Anything to energize my workforce.
And anyway, what makes yÃ¶u think
I could dislodge part of the church roof?
Or for that matter, stage a car crash?
It's a well known fact that the church roof is in dire need of repair.
And isn't it true that two of yÃ¶ur own employees
operate the vehicle removal service for the council?
Sergeant, this is the 21st Century.
Many people hold down several jobs.
I myself host a life drawing class at the Village Hall.
Tina here is a table dancer at Flappers.
Nevertheless, yÃ¶u could have utilized the vehicle removal truck for yÃ¶ur own ends.
These accusations are quite meaningless, Sergeant,
unless yÃ¶u can back them up with hard evidence.
Well, yÃ¶u've got me there.
I'd need something conclusive.
Something that placed yÃ¶u at the scene of the crime.
Perhaps a wound yÃ¶u sustained on a piece of broken glass this very evening.
This very evening.
Sergeant, this is beginning to get embarrassing.
How could I possibly be in several places at once?
I'm sure the store's security footage will absolve me.
Do feel free to spool through.
I can handle this, Danny.
yÃ¶u might as well go back and just enjoy the rest of yÃ¶ur birthday.
- Did yÃ¶u really get me that plant?
Yes, I did.
But it's been impounded as evidence.
Well, I mean, maybe Dad will still let me water it, eh?
Yeah.
Sergeant, I wanted yÃ¶u to know that
if I do indeed now own the land belonging to...
belonging to Leslie, that I intend to turn it into a memorial garden, in her honor.
Mr. Skinner, what yÃ¶u do with yÃ¶ur land is of no concern of mine,
so jog on.
Michael, will yÃ¶u escort the Sergeant off the premises when he's quite finished?
Yarp.
I just can't believe Leslie's dead.
How did it happen?
She tripped and fell on her own shears.
Hey, that weren't me.
Hey, look.
Look, Mr. Treacher's got his big coat on again.
- yÃ¶u want anything from the shop?
Cornetto.
- No luck catching them killers, then?
It's just the one killer, actually.
- No luck catching them killers, then?
It's just the one killer, actually.
- No luck catching them killers, then?
It's just the one killer, actually.
- No luck catching them killers, then?
It's just the one killer, actually.
- What's the matter? yÃ¶u got brain-freeze?
No, I got brainwave.
Get us back to the station, now!
- It's more than one person.
Come again?
- It's more than one killer.
It was Skinner a minute ago.
Yeah, well, maybe it still is.
yÃ¶u know, maybe he's... Maybe he's not alone. Maybe there are others.
Nicholas, yÃ¶u're an exceptional officer.
But I've seen this before.
- Sir?
Sergeant Popwell.
It was exactly the same thing.
yÃ¶u've come from a city where there's danger round every corner,
and it's driven yÃ¶u round the bend.
Yes, sir.
Do yÃ¶urself a favor. Sleep on it.
And if yÃ¶u still feel the same in the morning,
I give yÃ¶u my word, I'll get right on to it.
Hey. Hey, what's happening?
What's going on?
Nothing, nothing.
I'm just gonna go back to the hotel.
- I mean, do yÃ¶u want a lift?
No, no, I could do with a walk.
Hey, big one, playtime's over.
Michael?
Michael? Are yÃ¶u there?
Michael? Is everything okay?
Yarp.
Sergeant Angel's been taken care of?
Yarp.
He's not gonna get back up again?
Narp!
Good. Proceed to the castle.
Frank, this shit just got real.
Skinner just sent someone to kill me, and, now, now he's gone somewhere.
Up to the... To the castle, I think.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go after him.
Okay? It's Nicholas, by the way.
Oh, my God.
What happened to yÃ¶ur Peace Lily?
Danny. Danny, just stay here, okay?
And watch him, and call yÃ¶ur dad.
- Tell him I was right.
What are yÃ¶u gonna do?
- I'm gonna bust this thing wide open.
Nicholas, wait.
- yÃ¶u might need this.
Thanks, partner.
How could I possibly be in several places at once?
How could I possibly be in several places at once?
How could I possibly be in several places at once?
I just can't believe Leslie's dead.
How did it happen?
yÃ¶u'll find that we run a very tight ship here.
Who could do something like this?
Seems like Mr. Merchant tried to have a little fry up and left the gas on.
Nasty way to go.
What happened, Danny?
No luck catching them killers, then?
No luck catching them killers, then?
No luck catching them...
Now, quick announcement before we begin.
Janet Barker has decided to call her boys Roger and Martin.
And the christening will be a week on Saturday and we're all invited.
- Tom.
Thanks, Joyce.
Now, yÃ¶u'll all be delighted to hear
that the tenacious Sergeant Angel has been taken care of.
Joyce will discover the Sergeant lying on the wet floor of his bathroom,
having slipped and tragically broken his neck.
So, with the dispatch of the Sergeant,
we will now be able to concentrate on the eradication of our hoodie infestation.
Quite right.
After which, nothing will stand in our way.
Oh, I beg to differ, Mr. Weaver.
Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.
Sergeant Nicholas Angel.
Sandford Police Service.
My, he is tenacious, isn't he?
I'm arresting yÃ¶u under suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.
Oh, come, come, Sergeant.
yÃ¶u should be ashamed.
- Calling yÃ¶urself a community that cares.
Oh, but we do care, Nicholas.
It's all about the greater good.
The greater good.
How can this be for the greater good?
The greater good.
yÃ¶u see, as much as I enjoyed yÃ¶ur wild theories, Sergeant,
the truth is far less complex.
Blower's fate was simply the result of his being an appalling actor.
Quite appalling.
yÃ¶u murdered him for that?
- Well, he murdered Bill Shakespeare.
What?
The Dramatic Society is an important feather in our cap.
Couldn't let
Blower jeopardize that.
Not when we had two semi-professionals waiting in the wings.
Let's not forget that Greg was an extra in Straw Dogs.
And Sheree played a cadaver in Prime Suspect.
Yes, I know!
Martin was less concerned with the reputation of the village
than he was with his sordid affair with Eve Draper.
And so Eve deserved to die too?
Well, she did have a very annoying laugh.
Annoying.
- And, and George Merchant?
He had an awful house.
Awful.
We begged him in vain to make his residence
more in keeping with the village's rustic esthetic.
And what about Tim Messenger?
What was his crime?
Tim Messenger's tenure as editor of the Sandford Citizen has been unbearable.
Our once great paper had become riddled with tabloid journalism.
Not to mention persistent errors.
- He listed her age as 55.
When, actually, I'm 53.
Fifty-three.
What, what about Leslie Tiller?
One of yÃ¶ur own?
Her horticultural expertise helped put Sandford on the map.
Oh, she was ever so good.
Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.
But it seemed she was set on moving away.
We couldn't have her sharing her green fingers with anybody else.
Not least those heathens at Buford Abbey.
If we can't have her, no one can.
How can this be for the greater good?
- The greater good.
Shut it!
These people died for no reason.
No reason whatsoever!
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Hello, Nicholas.
I was like yÃ¶u once.
I believed in the immutable word of the law.
That is until the night Mrs. Butterman was taken from me.
yÃ¶u see, no one loved Sandford more than her.
She was head of the Women's Institute, chair of the floral committee.
When they started the Village of the Year contest,
she worked round the clock.
I've never seen such dedication.
On the eve of the adjudicator's arrival, some travelers moved into Callahan Park.
Before yÃ¶u could say, "Gypsy scum," we were knee-deep in dog muck,
thieving kids and crusty jugglers.
Crusty jugglers.
We lost the title and Irene lost her mind.
She drove her Datsun Cherry into Sandford Gorge.
From that moment on,
I swore that I would do her proud.
And whatever the cost, we would make Sandford great again.
Sir, this doesn't make any sense.
The adjudicators arrive tomorrow.
We had to get everything ready.
Are yÃ¶u saying this is all about winning the Best Village Award?
This is the best village, Nicholas. yÃ¶u've seen the people.
- They're happy, contented.
They're living in a dream world.
Sergeant Popwell thought much the same as yÃ¶u.
I'm disappointed yÃ¶u can't see the bigger picture.
Well, I'm happy to disappoint yÃ¶u, sir.
And I'm afraid yÃ¶u're gonna have to come with me.
yÃ¶u are all gonna have to come with me.
No, Nicholas, I'm afraid it is yÃ¶u
who is going to have to come with us.
Danny, no.
Back off! Back off!
Or I swear to God, yÃ¶u'll be explaining how Danny tripped over
and accidentally cut off his own head.
Come on, Nicholas. yÃ¶u haven't got it in yÃ¶u.
I mean it!
Shit!
Gypsy scum. Travelers.
Thieving kids. Dog muck.
Crusty jugglers.
Crusty jugglers. Crusty jugglers.
Crusty jugglers.
There hasn't been a recorded murder in Sandford for 20 years.
There's a reason we accommodate a few of the yÃ¶unglings at the pub.
Spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.
I'll make sure everyone gets their just deserts.
If we don't come down hard on these clowns...
We'll get round to it.
Danny!
Ta-da.
- What are yÃ¶u doing?
Saving yÃ¶ur skin.
- This is murder!
It's not, it's ketchup.
I'm not talking about that,
I'm talking about the others.
- What others?
The others the NWA have murdered.
- That's not true.
It is!
Dad just said it was his special club, he...
I thought it was about rapping people on the knuckles
- and sending them on their way.
There are skeletons back there!
I don't know nothing about no skelingtons.
- What did yÃ¶u think was happening?
Not this!
It's Frank.
He's appointed himself judge, jury and executioner.
- He's not Judge Judy and executioner.
He is!
- yÃ¶u've gotta help me take him down.
I can't.
He's my dad. Take my car.
Go back to London.
There's nothing yÃ¶u can do.
I can come back.
I can come back, and I can bring the blue fury
of the Metropolitan Police Service with me.
They'll make it disappear.
Who are they gonna believe?
My dad, or a loony London police officer.
But it won't be just me, will it?
We can do it together. yÃ¶u and me. Partners.
Forget it, Nicholas. It's Sandford.
Is that everything? Sir?
Sir? Sir?
- Is there anything I can do for yÃ¶u?
No.
This is something I have to do myself.
Another beautiful day in God's country.
Danny?
It's...
Mum!
What yÃ¶u gonna do?
Just walk in and arrest the whole village?
Not exactly.
Oh, Sergeant Angel?
Someone from London called for yÃ¶u.
I'll tell them yÃ¶u'll ring them back.
- Well, that's funny.
What's that?
I didn't know we had a mounted division.
Nobody tells me nothing.
Wanna do something useful?
Annette, that Sergeant Angel's back. Check out his horse.
Roger that!
- It's...
Angel.
Morning.
That's what I'm talking about.
Still feel like yÃ¶u're missing out?
Fascist!
Hag!
Stop! Stop this, please!
Let us stop this mindless violence.
Nicholas, my son.
yÃ¶u may not be a man of God, but surely yÃ¶u're a man of peace.
I may not be a man of God, Reverend, but I know right, and I know wrong,
and I have the good grace to know which is which.
Oh, fuck off, Grasshopper.
No!
Jesus Christ!
Nicholas! Nicholas!
I thought yÃ¶u was a goner.
Drop yÃ¶ur weapons!
- Dr. Hatcher, no!
Shut up, Danny.
I brought yÃ¶u into this world,
I think it's rather fitting
I should be the one to take yÃ¶u out of it.
yÃ¶u and yÃ¶ur interfering little friend.
Now...
drop them.
- yÃ¶u're a doctor, deal with it.
Yeah, motherfucker.
- Danny, let's roll.
What yÃ¶u thinking?
Pub?
Roy!
Somebody call the police!
Freeze!
Officers, arrest that man.
- Danny, step away from the Sergeant.
No, Dad.
Danny, yÃ¶u'll do as yÃ¶u're told.
I'm not taking orders from yÃ¶u anymore.
- Officers, arrest these men!
Wait, wait!
yÃ¶u can arrest us if yÃ¶u like.
yÃ¶u can throw us in prison and go back to being blind, submissive slaves.
Or yÃ¶u can be real police officers,
and help us bring an end to this absurd story.
What the fuck is he on about?
Fuck are yÃ¶u on about?
Have yÃ¶u ever wondered why the crime rate in Sandford is so low?
- And yet the accident rate, it's so high?
No. Yeah. What?
yÃ¶u've been brainwashed, Tony.
Brainwashed into naivety by an old man with a murderous obsession.
- This is ridiculous.
No, it's not, Dad. It's very unridiculous.
And it's only now that I'm starting to realize how unridiculous it all is.
Silence, Danny!
- Think of yÃ¶ur mother.
Mum is dead, Dad.
For the first time in my life, yÃ¶u know, I'm glad.
If she could see what yÃ¶u've become,
I think she'd probably kill herself all over again.
Sorry, I am completely lost.
Sandford is a lie, Doris.
For the last 20 years, the village has been controlled by Frank and the NWA.
They've lulled everyone into thinking this is a perfect village
and killed anyone who's threatened to change that.
I reckon he's got something there.
He says,
"He reckons yÃ¶u got something there."
I know.
yÃ¶u're not seriously gonna believe this man, are yÃ¶u?
Are yÃ¶u? He isn't even from round here.
Maybe it's time to give it up, sir.
yÃ¶u incompetent flatfoots!
Officer Walker, stay here with Saxon and hold everything down.
Fair enough.
Officers, let's go.
- What about Dad?
He'll come round again.
Want anything from the shop?
- What yÃ¶u thinking?
Well...
We should strike now, while we've got the element of surprise.
Longer we wait, more time they've got to mobilize.
I say we go in through the front entrance, take the place aisle by aisle.
They won't be expecting that.
Very good. What he said.
My, my. Here come the fuzz.
- Maybe they're not here.
Wait here.
- Don't go in on yÃ¶ur own.
Don't worry, he knows what he's doing.
Okay. They're in.
yÃ¶u deal with the store.
I'll deal with the trolley boy.
No, listen. Wait, wait, wait, Michael, wait, listen to me. Listen, listen.
Is this what yÃ¶u really, really want?
Yarp.
Suit yÃ¶urself.
Go, go, go.
Oh, come on.
Andy!
It's all right, Andy. It's just Bolognese!
- How's Lurch?
He's in the freezer.
- Did yÃ¶u say, "Cool off"?
No, I didn't say anything, actually.
Shame.
There was a bit earlier on that yÃ¶u missed
when I distracted him with the cuddly monkey.
And then I said, "Playtime's over," and I hit him with the Peace Lily.
yÃ¶u're off the fucking chain!
- What's the situation?
Two blokes and a fuckload of cutlery.
What do yÃ¶u reckon?
Idea.
Good work, everyone.
- Nice one, Doris.
Nothing like a bit of girl on girl.
Fruit attack!
Can yÃ¶u handle this, Sergeant Fisher?
We're gonna go after the big boss.
We're on it, Sergeant.
- Danny, let's rock.
Angel!
Don't go being a twat now.
I wouldn't give yÃ¶u the satisfaction.
- We should get down there.
How?
Skip.
- Head them off?
Fuck, yeah.
- I'll drive.
Shotgun! Punch that shit!
Bang! Bang!
Swan!
Swan!
Stay back! Or the ginger nut gets it!
yÃ¶u little fucker!
Get out of my village!
It's not yÃ¶ur village anymore.
- yÃ¶u did good, kid.
Ta.
- What's yÃ¶ur name?
Aaron A. Aaronson.
Sorry?
Angel!
It's over, Danny.
It's over.
This really hurts.
I'm going to need some ice-cream.
Yeah, well, don't worry.
There's plenty of ice-cream at the station.
Isn't that right, Danny?
Stay back!
- Pack it in, Frank, yÃ¶u silly bastard!
Now, now.
We don't want any more bloodshed.
Frank, this whole thing started because yÃ¶u lost somebody yÃ¶u loved.
Don't expect me to believe yÃ¶u'd let it end the same way.
I'll tell yÃ¶u how this is gonna end!
I feel like I should say something smart.
yÃ¶u don't have to say anything at all.
Satisfactory conclusion to the whole operation.
Now, my perfect Sunday would begin with...
What do yÃ¶u say, Nicholas?
We... We...
We have been trying to reach yÃ¶u for days.
- Yeah, well, I've been kind of busy.
We need yÃ¶u back.
The figures have gone a little squiffy in yÃ¶ur absence, it has to be said.
Come back to London.
Sandford's hardly a fitting place for such an exceptional officer.
Yeah, well, the thing is, sir.
I kind of like it here.
Besides, we have to do a considerable amount of paperwork.
- Fuck's sake, Nick, this is gonna take ages.
Yeah, it's gonna take all night.
Well, good job we've got the manpower, Andy?
Well, official vocab guidelines state that we say "staffing," not "manpower,"
'cause "manpower's" a bit sexist.
yÃ¶u don't mind a bit of manpower do yÃ¶u, Doris?
Oh, dirty bastard!
Andy!
yÃ¶u cheeky fucker!
yÃ¶u know what yÃ¶u are?
A bloody busybody!
No!
Oh, God, no!
Danny!
Danny!
Oh, God.
Hold on, Danny, just hold on.
Hold on, it's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.
Just hang on, hang on!
Everything's gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be just fine.
Hope these are okay.
Yeah. They're lovely.
- Any officers near the church?
Go ahead, Doris.
Chief, we've had a report of some hippy types
messing with the recycling bins at the supermarket.
- Leave it with us.
Righto.
Sergeant Butterman, little hand says it's time to rock and roll.
Bring the noise.
