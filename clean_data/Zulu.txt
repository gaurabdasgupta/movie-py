Tick? It is the town of drug.
We are dealing with a rich kid.
Not an abuse.
No, she does.
The medical exam unfold result of blood revealed the presence of ammonia and ephedrine.
We suggest she was using tik.
It possible some one drugged did the abuser?
She has sexual intercourses, but she wasn't raped.
A man, the priority is to find a partner.
Is he the killer?
Or, he'd come forward by now.
It's possible.
But it could be that he just sold her the Tick and doesn't want the problem.
In any case, we are looking for him.
What about the DNA samples.
Nothing useful there.
Have you spoken to the Attorney General?

The past is the past.
So can we play cards?
Kruger was amnestied.

It's so easy that you pay before misguide Force of Commission,
You confessed all the evil degent And presto, bang, all was forgiven.

A slage exaggeration, don't you think?
We were too easy among us to breaks.
They got we key,
Free as fucking birds.
Prosper than ever as if nothing had happened.
Would you have preferred?
Retribution?
More death?
Not retribution, Ali.
Justice.
I would prefer justice.
Claire, If there's one at the table.
Who possibly want to take revenge? Is Ali.
But it turns out he's...
Strength and intelligence.
To forgive!

With your enemies,."
" Working with your enemies."

This is the same drug Nicole Weitz took the night of her death.
It's exactly the same synthetic methamphetamine cocktail but when I did further analysis I discovered add a couple of unknown molecule.
With an unknown molecule.

Hi, Janet.
Dan's wife doesn't want anyone from the department.
I can stay for a while, anyhow.
Do not worry, I will give my distance.
As you like. I am going.
Captain!
I took the liberty of checking out a few things on the Internet.
For around the hut with where Dan was.
There is nothing except one isolated house about a half km away.
I tried to find out who lives there. No one.
The house was sold 8 months ago. The said agency attends presale never saw the owner.
The entire action shore cooperation.
And money was transferred from offshore accounts in Cayman Islands.
If you want, I can try to find those behind this.
Good work. Thank you very much.
How would you like to join my team?
Congratulations, Jane.
I hope you don't mind that.
Someday an insomniac Zulu calling you announced dispense justice remuneration.

You come riding around very often.
Every morning.
Isn't it?
You know who lives here?
You've seen anyone around?
So are you a policeman?
Depends who's asking.
I saw a 4x4 once.
When.
About ten days ago.

But you will be available if we need you?
Of course.
How about tonight?
That's it. I saw this child several times.
It's horrible...
12 years old!
Suicide? Are you sure?
We think it's possible side effect.
Some new drugs certainly near the area.
But the last time I saw him I didn't make a note that he was on drugs.
What I learn to him, he was with another kid at his age.
Simon belong to a gang out street kids all hang out in gang stage.
You had medical files for the reserve?
Sure, but haven't seen them in a while. As they vanished.
You told the police?
What?
The lost kids.
We must tell them!
Pardon, but the police couldn't care less about street kids.
And I am been kind of saying that.
And this is another kid there.
You look awful!
Try to sleep, Ali.
Those kids are disappearing
I'm looking into myself.
Oh, that's right, my son.
If your girlfriends happen to see one of them...
Ok.
I am not ask to mention it to people.
Not finding any municipality.

Detective...
Detective!
Sorry.
Hi, Jane.
I checked for the security company.
You know, DPS, the security company?
Woo, woo Wait a second.
Look, I am listening.
DPS
The security company,
Officially, there is no contract for the beach house.
But I took liberty of hacking
DPS's computer systems.
Over the past 6 months.
The offshore companies that own the house.
Paid of three million rand to DPS!
Shit... enough monitor and drugs in the houses.
In the DPS's cunstom files.
It is South African cellphone number that listed full of the offshore company.
Dr Joost Opperman. It's the cellphone number belongs to him.
What kind of doctor.
A geeky researcher.
A genius molecular chemistry founder creak.
Opperman.
Type " Opperman, Project Coast..."
That's it.
The Bastards who are part of Beach project.
You haven't heard about it?
You are too young.
A nut.
A secret project. Scientists and medical officers by the regime to develop chemical weapons virus, this kind of shit.
Anything can come up prevent blacks increase any number.
Dr Opperman.
Testify before the Truth and
Reconciliation Commision.
Of course.
Government gave us carte blanch.
We have 200 scientists.
Our mission is to develop might calling... ethnic bomb.
Could you be more specific?
A chemical weapons.
A molecule capable to desolating the black population.
But I was following the Chain of command by orders from my top.
Not my place to question them.
These girls is.
Just the tip of the iceberg.
Opperman has developed molecules that makes people go crazy and was stashed in dark.
He use Cat's gang to dumped it off from streets in the town shop?
That would explain why
Kids are disappearing.
They must kill each other or themselves.
And the youth you find in the pipe.
Yeah, but what about
Nicole Weitz?
Probably not part of the plan.
The beach house was their lab, Stan was watching over.
He must has taken advantage of the seller.
In most of the bright ideas to sell tick to white kids on the side.
Where is this Dr. Opperman?
He left the country after remit by the commission.
It's like he vanishes in the air.
If you like, I can try to track his bank account.
My friend Kruger's lock the same.
As well, we will not go to tell him.
Didn't you have an operation last night?
Go and check out the security company.
