(SONAR PINGING)
La Rochelle, France. Autumn, 1941.
The German U-boat fleet is suffering its first major setbacks.
British freighters are sailing with stronger Destroyer escorts.
But Germany is constantly sending new U-boats into battle.
Keeping the Allies in check in the Atlantic.
Of 40,000 German sailors, 30,000 never return.

Merkel's guys.
They ship out tomorrow too.
(GROUP SINGING)
Okay, sailors!
Let's go set that cat house on fire!
Just don't miss your mark!
Stuff some season's greetings in there!
Scared fuckers.
They need sex like the infantry needs alcohol.
OFFICER :
What's going on here?
Good luck!
(MEN LAUGHING)
Captain!
My 2nd officer.
This is Lieutenant Werner, naval war correspondent.
He'll ship out with us.
He'll report anything of interest.
Welcome aboard, lieutenant.
Good evening.
This way, lieutenant.
U-boat crews need relaxation.
Good evening.
Two beers.
Yes, captain.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Where's Thomsen?
Doesn't he want to celebrate his medal?
Any news from your wife?
No personal calls allowed till after 10 p.m.
Two beers.
(SPEAKING IN GERMAN)
(CLICKS HEELS)
Reporting back from U-96.
Munitions and provisions aboard, ready to put to sea.
Thanks, 1 st.
Something else, captain.
On my way here, some of the crew harassed me.
They actually...
An incredible incident...
They...
They pissed on you.
Yes.
Me too.
Just a minute!
Attention, please!
Let's give our newly decorated officer,
Captain Thomsen, three cheers!
(ALL CHANTING)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
That's Thomsen for you.
One of the old guard.
Always drunk now.
My respects, Thomsen!
Quiet in this whorehouse!
(MIC FEEDBACKS)
A toast to our wonderful, abstaining, woman less FÃ¼hrer.
Who rose gloriously from apprentice painter to become the world's greatest battle strategist.
What? Isn't it true?
He's the great naval expert, who took it upon himself, in his wisdom...
How's it go again?
Who's been showing that English bed wetter, that cigar-chomping asshole Churchill,
(ALL LAUGHING) where to go stick his cigars!
(CHEERS AND LAUGHTER)
(CROWD SINGING OUTSIDE)
Sorry.
See you tomorrow.
I've got a call to make.
It's not like the old gang.
These are so green and eager.
Wet behind the ears.
Braggarts.
Cheeks together, balls in their hands, and belief in the FÃ¼hrer in their eyes.
They'll calm down soon enough.

I am not in the condition to fuck.
It's all right.
(SPEAKS IN GERMAN)
(CREAKING AND RATTLING)
That's Thomsen's boat.
Equipment checks okay?
The starboard propeller had a bent blade.
Uh-huh.
That's what caused whining on silent runs.
We have a brand-new propeller now, captain.

Captain's revue, eyes left.

(ALL LAUGH)
Thank you, gentlemen.
Follow me.
This is our shit house.
Uh-huh.
One hole for fifty men.
Oh.
The other's full of provisions.
More space for food than for shit. Some logic.
(LAUGHS)
Chief petty officer's.
Uh-huh.
My home, so to speak.
Here's the officers' mess.
Don't stow stuff that way!
(WOMAN SINGING

It's nice in here.
Where are you?
Sorry, coming. May I?
MAN #1 :

BOSUN :
Here's the radio room.
Over here, the control room.
Just what we need.
The control room.
The boat's command center.
(MAN 2 SPEAKS IN GERMAN)
This leads to quarters.
Gotta move this stuff.
MAN #3 :
Morning, lieutenant.
Petty officers sleep here.
Twelve men.
Two men share most bunks, depending on their duties.
If one's on guard, the next one sleeps in the other's stink. Right?
(LAUGHING)
This is your bunk.
Just for you, our guest.
That's for you too.
Your oxygen mask.
Very important!
Not much good except in calm seas.
It comes in handy when the diesel reeks.
(LAUGHING)
Or when Frenssen farts.
Come along.
Coming through!
This is the galley.
And this is Johann, the ghost.
(SPEAKS IN GERMAN)
BOSUN :
Hey, Johann, everything greased up?
MAN #4 :
Man on bridge?
(MAN5 SPEAKS IN GERMAN)
Take photos of the crew returning, not putting out to sea.
Why?
They'll have beards by then.
It would shame the Brits to see mere boys give them hell.
Baby faces, who should still suck Mama's breast.
I feel ancient around these kids.
Like l'm on some Children's Crusade.
Permission to pass?
(SPEAKS IN GERMAN)
(SPEAKS IN GERMAN)
You're from Mexico?
Yes, south of Mexico City.
Nice?
Yes, sir.
Great climate, due to the high altitude.
You came a long way.
As a German, it was a matter of course.
What did you do there?
I worked on my step-parents' plantation.
The boss' son?
You could put it that way.
MAN : (OVER PA)
Stand by, first watch and engine watch.
Excuse me.
(BUMPS TABLE)
Permission to pass?

Yeah, sure, the two salesgirls,
Jeannette and...
What's her name?
Francoise.
We're engaged.
Secretly, of course.
May I?
Really very pretty.
What's wrong?
She's pregnant.
But, you know what that means.
Once the Partisans find out, her kid's half-German...
What can I do?
She definitely wants it.
You've got a problem.
(MEN SPEAKING OVER RADIO)
Those guys in Berlin got nothing but insults for Churchill.
How's it go again?
"Drunkard."
"Guzzler."
"Paralytic."
He's sending a lot of heat our way for a paralyzed drunk.
Nonetheless, we'll force him to his knees.
That is my firm belief.
Listen, smart guy, he's far from being on his knees.
Wonder how many ships get through.
Especially now, while we're staring at the walls and waiting.
Where are our planes and scouts,
Herr GÃ¶ring?
The enemy's got plenty.
Hot air, that's all that comes out of that fat slob.
Braggarts, nothing but braggarts.
All of them.
Go on, take it down.
Notes, for your "Heroes' Epic" and the propaganda machine.
Where's the music?
Our Hitler Youth leader here could play us a record.

(SPEAKING IN GERMAN)
A new course?
Wait and see.
May I see the radiogram?
"Convoy reported, coordinates AK 22, general course about 60 degrees at 8 nautical miles."
From U-37.
U-37 is Marten's boat.
He's after a convoy.

Because I've got some in my ass.
We can tie them together.

"Attention to personal hygiene and dress are not just appearances.
It reflects an upright, clean interior, thus influencing the surroundings.
The true officer is unpretentious, in character and wardrobe, which was not always the case, when superiors were more lenient, because a German lieutenant always knew how to die."
Comfy place, huh?
No mail, no phones.
A well-ventilated boat.
Attractive wood paneling.
Free home cooking.
We're sitting in clover.
Like horse droppings.
It sits in clover too.
It doesn't worry about anything, and it gets to let off steam.

I hope we blast off some eels.
It'll clear some space!
More than 30 freighters!

Berthold better not attack now.
Ought to stay close until the other boats arrive.
There is nothing more beautiful than a submarine, and a sailboat.
There are no better lines than those of a sailboat.
I sailed on a 3-masted schooner once.
Gorgeous ship.
It had holds the size of a cathedral!
(BOTH LAUGH)
That burns some fuel, huh?
Asshole.

We've been ordered to a new port.

Fuel and provisions out of Vigo first.
That's in Spain.

No getting laid.

The Mediterranean.
They're nuts.
It's swarming with English combat ships.
Stand by for calculations!

Gibraltar.
Excellent prospects for drowning.
You and the chief will go ashore in Vigo.
How's that?
I'll radio it in a minute.
I'll have to find a replacement for the chief.
They'll smuggle you through Spain somehow, even if you have to dress like gypsies.
But I was on for the whole...
No heroics.
It's already settled.
One guy alone would be tough.
We've got agents to get you through.
Chief's wife is very ill.
He's got to go ashore.
Aye, aye, sir.
Pretty bad, huh?
I'm going ashore at Vigo with the chief.

Welcome aboard the "Weser," captain.

The famous grey wolves, with us, inside our modest cabin, so to speak.
Captain, allow me.
BOTH :
A warm welcome.
Nice tugboat you've got here.
(ALL CHATTERING)
We're well prepared, in all modesty, of course, but not bad at all.
Like a taste of home, so to speak.
Fresh bread, cakes from our own bakery, bacon, fresh sausages, stuffed just today, naturally.
(SIGHS)
You've got to tell us your news.
You can't imagine our curiosity.
It's not an easy life here, appearances to the contrary.
There's plenty of fuel and food to eat, but torpedoes are difficult to come by.
But we always have our ways.
The Spaniards tolerate us, but there's no love lost between us.
Christmas bread.
Hmm? So, tell me, how many ships have you sunk?

The champagne.

It's probably just as well.
Who knows who they'd replace me with?
Might be one of those wet-behind-the-ears kids.
Very well could be.
They should've put some pussy in storage for screwing.
Yeah, you'd be fighting

A tight squeeze, l'd say.
These are the British docks.
Their only port for repairs in the western Mediterranean.
It will be well protected.
All kinds of defenses.
Anything floating will be on the water.
We'll have to maneuver through it.
That's the situation.
We'll move under cover of darkness, skimming the surface.
We'll cut right through the English ships.
As close to the Strait of Gibraltar as we can get.
Then we'll dive, and let ourselves drop.

Good question.
Some air may be left in the ballast tanks, from all that blowing.
That might help us.
With every last bit of air pressure, maybe...
We've got to reduce our weight.
That water has to get out.
Might work. It just might!
Aft is almost bailed.
It could work, by hand into tanks, then with main pump, and air pressure, the water's pushed out.

Then we go for broke.
Blow tanks, and...
We'll get only one try.

That old fox knew it all along.
Since he got that radiogram, ordering us to break through.
That's why he wanted us off the boat in Vigo.
There was no chance to get through.
He wanted to make us believe it was possible with a simple trick.

Not a bad trick, except that it had to work.
Will we ever surface, chief?
I don't know.
