They're following us.
If they knew we were here, they would've killed us already.

This is it.
This is where Forrestal cashed in.
A friend of yours?
A competitor.
He was good.
He was very, very good.
SeÃ±or... nobody's come out of there alive.
Please...
[water dripping]
[quietly]:
SeÃ±or.

Forrestal.

There is nothing to fear here.
That's what scares me.

Stay here.

Dr. Jones.
Again we see there is nothing you can possess which I cannot take away.
And you thought
I had given up.
[bows creak]
You chose the wrong friends.
This time, it will cost you.
Too bad the Hovitos... don't know you the way I do, Belloq.
Yes, too bad.
You could warn them, if only you spoke Hovitos.

There's a big snake in the plane, Jock!
Oh, that's just my pet snake Reggie!
I hate snakes, Jock!
I hate 'em!
Come on!
Show a little backbone, will ya?
[engine thrumming]
JONES:
"Neo," meaning "new" and "lithic"... I-T-H...
[students chuckling]
...I-C, meaning "stone."
All right, let's get back to this site:
Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.
Contains a central pas-passage and three chambers, or cysts...
...don't confuse that with robbing, in which case we mean...
[door clicking open]
...the removal of the contents of the barrow.
This site also demonstrates...
...one of the great dangers of archaeology-- not to life and limb, although that does sometimes take place-- no, I'm talking about folklore.
In this case, local tradition held that there was golden coffin buried at the site, and this accounts for the holes dug all over the barrow and the generally poor condition of the find.
However, chamber three was undisturbed, and the undisturbed chamber and the grave goods that were found in another, uh-- in the area, give us a r--
Uh...
...reason to da-- to, uh, to-to date this, uh, find as we have.
Um...
[bell rings]
Any questions, then?
No? Okay, that's it for the day, then.
Um, don't forget--
Michaelson, chapters four and five for next time.
And I will be in my office on Thursday, but not Wednesday.
[students chatting indistinctly]
I had it, Marcus.
I had it in my hand.
What happened?
Guess.
[chuckles]
Belloq?
You want to hear about it?
Not at all.
I'm sure everything you do for the museum conforms to the International Treaty for the Protection of Antiquities.
It's beautiful, Marcus.
I can get it.
I got it all figured out.
There's only one place he can sell it: Marrakech.
I need $2,000. Look--
Listen to me, old boy.
I brought some people to see you.
Look.
I got these pieces.
They're good pieces, Marcus.
Look.
Indiana...
Yes, the museum will buy them, as usual, no questions asked.
Yes, they are nice.
They're worth at least the price of a ticket to Marrakech.
But the people
I brought are important, and they're waiting.
What people?
Army Intelligence.
They knew you were coming before I did.
Seem to know everything.
They wouldn't tell me what they want.
Well, what do I want to see them for?
What am I, in trouble?
MUSGROVE:
Yes, Dr. Jones, we've heard a great deal about you.
Have you?
MUSGROVE:
Uh, professor of archaeology, expert on the occult, and, uh, how does one say it?
Obtainer of rare antiquities.
That's one way of saying it.
Why don't you sit down?
You'll be more comfortable.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Yes, you're a man of many talents.
Now, you studied under Professor Ravenwood at the University of Chicago.
Yes, I did.
You have no idea of his present whereabouts?
Uh... well, just rumors, really.
Somewhere in Asia,
I think.
I haven't really spoken to him for ten years.
We were friends, but, uh... had a bit of a falling out,
I'm afraid.
MUSGROVE:
Mmm.
Dr. Jones, now, you must understand that this is all strictly confidential, eh?
I understand.
Uh...
[clears throat]
Yesterday afternoon, our European sections intercepted a... a German communiquÃ© that was sent from
Cairo to Berlin.
Now, to Cairo...
See, over the last two years, the Nazis have had teams of archaeologists running around the world looking for all kinds of religious artifacts.
Hitler's a nut on the subject.
He's crazy.
He's obsessed with the occult.
And, right now, apparently, there's some kind of German archaeological dig going on in the desert outside of Cairo.
Now, we've got some information here, but we can't make anything out of it, and maybe you can.
"Tanis development proceeding.
[mouthing] "Acquire headpiece,
Staff of Ra.
Abner Ravenwood, U.S."
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.
MUSGROVE: Just what does that mean to you, uh, Tanis?
Well, it--
The city of Tanis is one of the possible resting places of the Lost Ark.
The Lost Ark?
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.
The chest the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments.
What do you mean,
"commandments"?
You talking about the Ten Commandments?
Yes, the actual
Ten Commandments.
The original stone tablets that Moses brought down out of Mount Horeb and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing.
Any of you guys ever go to Sunday school?
Well, I...
INDIANA:
Oh, look.
The Hebrews took the broken pieces and put them in the Ark.
When they settled in Canaan, they put the Ark in a place called the Temple of Solomon.
In Jerusalem.
Where it stayed for many years.
Until, all of a sudden, whoosh, it's gone.
Where?
Well, nobody knows where or when.
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...
Shishak.
Yes.
...invaded the city of Jerusalem right about 980 BC, and he may have taken the Ark back to the city of Tanis and hidden it in a secret chamber called the Well of Souls.
Secret chamber?
BRODY:
However, about a year after the pharaoh would return to Egypt, the city of Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year.
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.
Uh-huh.
Obviously, we've come to the right men.
Now you seem to know, uh, all about this Tanis, then.
No, no, not really.
Ravenwood is the real expert.
Abner did the first serious work on Tanis.
Collected some of its relics.
It was his obsession, really.
But he never found the city.
Frankly, we're somewhat suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.
An American being mentioned so prominently in a secret
Nazi cable.
Oh, rubbish.
Ravenwood's no Nazi.
Well, what do the Nazis want him for, then?
Well, obviously, the Nazis are looking for the headpiece to the Staff of Ra and they think
Abner's got it.
What exactly is a headpiece to the Staff of Ra?
Well, the staff is just a stick--
I don't know, about this big, nobody really knows for sure how high-- and it's... it's, uh... it's capped with an elaborate headpiece... in the shape of the sun, with a crystal in the center.
And what you did was you take the staff to a special room in Tanis-- a map room with a miniature of the city all laid out on the floor-- and if you put the staff in a certain place, at a certain time of day, the sun shone through here and made a beam that came down on the floor here... and gave you the exact location of the Well of the Souls.
Where the Ark of the
Covenant was kept, right?
Which is exactly what the Nazis are looking for.
What does this Ark look like?
Uh...
There's a picture of it right here.
That's it.
EATON:
Good God.
Yes, that's just what the Hebrews thought.
Uh... now, what's that supposed to be coming out of there?
INDIANA:
Lightning... fire... power of God or something.
MUSGROVE: I'm beginning to understand
Hitler's interest in this.
BRODY:
Oh, yes.
The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains, and laying waste to entire regions.
An army which carries the Ark before it... is invincible.
You did it, didn't you?
They want you to go for it.
Oh, Marcus!
They want you to get ahold of the Ark before the Nazis do and they're prepared to pay handsomely for it.
And the museum?
The museum gets the Ark when we're finished?
Oh, yes.
Oh...
The Ark of the Covenant.
Nothing else has come close.
That thing represents everything we got into archaeology for in the first place.
Mmm!
You know, five years ago,
I would've gone after it myself.
I'm really rather envious.
I've got to locate Abner.
I think I know where to start.
Suppose she'll still be with him?
Possibly, but...
Marion's the least of your worries right now, believe me, Indy.
What do you mean?
Well, I mean that for nearly 3,000 years, man has been searching for the Lost Ark.
Not something to be taken lightly.
No one knows its secrets.
It's like nothing you've ever gone after before.
[chuckles]
Oh, Marcus.
What are you trying to do, scare me?
You sound like my mother.
We've known each other for a long time.
I don't believe in magic, a lot of superstitious hocus-pocus.
I'm going after a find of incredible historical significance.
You're talking about the bogeyman.
Besides, you know what a cautious fellow I am.
[engine starting]
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Jones.
Thank you.

INDIANA:
Hello, Marion.
[door closing]
[glass shatters]
[sighs]
[chuckles]
Indiana Jones.
[heavy sigh]
Always knew, someday, you'd come walking back through my door.
I never doubted that.
Something made it inevitable.
So, what are you doing here in Nepal?
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
I learned to hate you in the last ten years.
I never meant to hurt you.
I was a child.
I was in love.
It was wrong and you knew it!
You knew what you were doing.
Now I do!
This is my place.
Get out!
[speaking foreign language]
[man replies in native language]
I did what I did.
You don't have to be happy about it, but maybe we could help each other out now.
[door closing]
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
Bronze piece, about this size, with a hole in it, off-center, with a crystal.
You know the one I mean?
Yeah.
I know it.
Where's Abner?
Where's Abner?
Abner's dead.
Marion, I'm sorry.
Do you know what you did to me, to my life?
I can only say
I'm sorry so many times.
Well, say it again, anyway.
Sorry.
Yeah, everybody's sorry.
Abner was sorry for dragging me all over this earth looking for his little bits of junk.
I'm sorry to still be stuck in this dive.
Everybody's sorry for something.
It's a worthless bronze medallion, Marion.
You going to give it to me?
Maybe.
I don't know where it is.
Well, maybe you could find it.
3,000 bucks.
Well, that will get me back, but not in style.
I can get you another two when we get to the States.
It's important, Marion.
Trust me.
You know the piece I mean?
Do you know where it is?
[chuckles]
Come back tomorrow.
Why?
Because I said so, that's why.
Ha!
See you tomorrow,
Indiana Jones.

[German accent]:
Good evening, Fraulein.
MARION:
The bar's closed.
We... We are... [laughs] not thirsty.
What do you want?
The same thing your friend
Dr. Jones wanted.
Surely he told you there would be other interested parties.
Must've slipped his mind.
[snickering]:
The man is... nefarious.
I hope, for your sake, he has not yet acquired it.
Why, are you willing to offer more?
Oh, almost certainly.
Do you still have it?
[coughing]
No.
But I know where it is.
Hey, how about a drink for you and your men?
Your fire is dying here.
Why don't you tell me where the piece is right now?
Listen, Herr Mac...
I don't know what kind of people you're used to dealing with, but nobody tells me what to do in my place.
Fraulein Ravenwood, let me show you what I am used to.
[barks command in German]
Take your hands off me!
[grunting, glass shattering]
Take your lousy hands off!
[grunting]
[anxious gasping]
Wait a minute.
Wait, I... I can be reasonable.
That time is passed.
You don't need that.
[whimpering]
Wait...
[whimpering]
I'll tell you everything.
Yes, I know you will.

[wind blowing]
Well, Jones, at least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time!
Boy, you're something!
Yeah, I'll tell you what.
Until I get back my $5,000, you're going to get more than you bargained for.
I'm your goddamn partner!
[children laughing in distance]
Cairo, city of the living.
A paradise on earth.
[laughing]
Silence!
Why do you forget yourselves?
What is this?
Where did this animal come from?
[monkey chittering]
Oh... oh, no.
[all laughing]
Cute.
What an adorable creature.
[laughing]
Then it shall be welcome in our house.
Oh, well, no, you don't have to keep it here just because of me.
[children laughing]
[chuckling]
I knew the Germans would hire you, Sallah.
You're the best digger in Egypt.
My services are entirely inconsequential to them.
They've hired or shanghaied every digger in Cairo.
The excavation is enormous.
They hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them.
It's as if the pharaohs had returned.
When did they find the map room?
Three days ago.
They have not one brain among them.
Except one.
He is very clever.
He's a French archaeologist.
What's his name?
They call him "Bellosh."
[laughing]
Belloq. Belloq.
The Germans have a great advantage over us.
They are near to discovering the Well of Souls.
Well, they're not going to find it without this.
Who can tell us about these markings?
Perhaps a man I know can help us.
Indy...
[sighs] there is something that troubles me.
What is it?
The Ark.
If it is there, at Tanis, then it is something that man was not meant to disturb.
Death has always surrounded it.
It is not of this earth.
Do we need the monkey, huh?
I'm surprised at you, Jones-- talking that way about our baby.
He's got your looks, too.
And your brains.
[laughing]:
Oops!
I noticed that.
She's a smart little thing-- smart.
[laughs and screams]
Hey!
Hey, where you going?
She'll be all right.
Have a date.
Come on. Come on.
Okay...
Marion.
What's this?
It's a date.
You eat 'em.
[sniffling and grunting]
[chittering]
Sieg heil!
Ja.
[screeches]
Heil Hitler.
Sieg heil!
[speaking German]
MARION: How come you haven't found some nice girl to settle down with, raise eight or nine kids, like your friend Sallah?
INDIANA:
Who says I haven't?
[laughs]
[spits]
I do.
Dad had you figured a long time ago.
He said you were a bum.
Oh, he's being generous.
The most gifted bum he ever trained.
You know, he loved you like a son.
Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.
Not much, just you.
[cloth ripping]
Marion, get out of here!
Duck!
[horse neighs]
[laughing]
Right.
[clanging]

Shh! Shh!
Marion!

MARION:
Help! Over here, Indy!
Get out of the way!
Move! Move it!
MARION:
Help me!
MARION:
You can't do this to me!
I'm an American!
Indy!
Indiana Jones!
Help me, Jones!

Indy!

MAN:
Dr. Jones.
[speaking German]
[monkey chittering]
You looking for me?
[laughing]
Belloq.
Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.
I ought to kill you right now.
Not a very private place for a murder.
Well, these Arabs don't care if we kill each other.
They're not going to interfere in our business.
It was not I who brought the girl into this business.
Please, sit down before you fall down.
We can at least behave like civilized people.
[monkey chittering]
I see your taste in friends remains consistent.
How odd that it should end this way for us, after so many stimulating encounters.
I almost regret it.
Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?
Try the local sewer.
[quiet laugh]
You and I are very much alike.
Archaeology is our religion, yet we have both fallen from the purer faith.
Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend.
I am a shadowy reflection of you.
It would take only a nudge to make you like me, to push you out of the light.
Now you're getting nasty.
You know it's true.
How nice.
Look at this.
It's worthless.
Ten dollars from a vendor in the street.
But I take it,
I bury it in the sand for a thousand years, it becomes priceless... like the Ark.
Men will kill for it.
Men like you and me.
What about your boss, der Fuehrer?
I thought he was waiting to take possession.
All in good time.
When I am finished with it.
Jones, do you realize what the Ark is?
It's a transmitter.
It's a radio for speaking to God.
And it's within my reach.
You want to talk to God?
Let's go see Him together.
I've got nothing better to do.
BOY:
Uncle Indy, come back home now!
[children clamoring]
Uncle Indy!
[crowd laughing]
Next time, Indiana Jones, it'll take more than children to save you.
[children clamoring]
GIRL:
Uncle Indy!
[crowd laughing]
I thought I would find you there.
Better than the United
States Marines, eh?
[monkey chittering]
[all laughing]
Marion's dead.
Yes, I know.
GIRL:
And me! And me!
I'm sorry.
Life goes on, Indy.
There is the proof.
[chitters]
Uh-oh.
I have much to tell you.
First we will take them home, and then I will take you to the old man.
[engine starts]
[men singing prayers in distance]
[crickets chirping]
[wind chimes tinkling gently]
[hinges creaking]
[top unscrews, pops]
INDIANA: I can't figure out how Belloq did it.
Where'd he get a copy of the headpiece?
There are no pictures, no duplicates of it anywhere.
I tell you only what I saw with my own eyes:
A headpiece like that one, except round the edges, which were rougher.
In the center, the Frenchman had embedded a crystal, and... and surrounding the crystal, on one side, there were raised markings, just like that one.
They made their calculations in the map room?
This morning.
Belloq and the boss
German, Dietrich.
When they came out of the map room, they gave us a new spot in which to dig, out away from the camp.
The Well of the Souls, huh?
Come, come, look.
Look here... look.
Sit down.
Come, sit down.
What is it?
This is a warning not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.
What about the height of the staff, though?
Did Belloq get it off of here?
Yes.
It is here.
This were the old way,
this mean six kadam high.
About 72 inches.
Wait!
"And take back one kadam to honor the Hebrew God whose Ark this is."
[wind chimes tinkling]
[wind blows eerily]
[wind subsides]
You said their headpiece only had markings on one side.
Are you absolutely sure?
Belloq's staff is too long.
BOTH: They're digging in the wrong place.
[lilting laughter] âª I am the monarch of the sea âª âª I am the ruler of the--
[gasps]
Bad dates.
I told you not to be premature in your communiquÃ© to Berlin.
Archaeology is not an exact science.
It does not deal in time schedules.
The fuehrer is not a patient man.
He demands constant reports, and he expects progress.
You led me to believe...
Nothing!
I made no promises.
I only said it looked very favorable.
Besides, with the information in our possession, my calculations were correct.
INDIANA: Boy, they're not kidding, are they?
What time does the sun hit the map room?
SALLAH: At about 9:00 in the morning.
Not much time, then.
Where are they digging for the Well of the Souls?
On that ridge... but the map room's over there.
Let's go, come on.

I shall get it for you.
If you want water,
I will get you water.
No problem, no problem.
[muffled cry]
I thought you were dead.
You must have switched baskets.
[laughing]
Are you hurt?
No. You have to get me out of here, quick.
They're gonna be back at any minute.
Cut me loose.
Quick.
They keep asking about you.
What you know.
What's wrong?
Cut me loose.
I know where the
Ark is, Marion.
The Ark's here?
I'm coming with you, Jones.
Get me out of here!
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!
If I take you out of here now, they'll start combing the place for us.
Jones, you've got to get me out of here!
Come on, Jones, are you crazy?!
Marion, I hate to do this, but if you don't sit still and keep quiet, this whole thing is going to be shot.
[gasping]
I'll be back to get you.
Jones, what's the matter?
[quiet laugh]
That's it.
BELLOQ:
Who knows?
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting in some antechamber for us to discover.
Perhaps there's some vital bit of evidence which eludes us.
Perhaps...
Perhaps the girl can help us.
My feeling exactly.
She was in possession of the original piece for years.
She may know much, if properly motivated.
I tell you, the girl knows nothing.
[chuckles]
I'm surprised to find you squeamish.
That is not your reputation.
But it needn't concern you.
I have the perfect man for this kind of work.
Heil Hitler.

If you're trying to escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction, so please, eat something.
I must apologize for their treatment of you.
Yeah. Whose idea was it?
No food, no water.
What kind of people are these friends of yours?
At this particular time and place, to do my work, they are necessary evils.
They're not my friends.
However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world, we are not entirely uncivilized.
[huffs]
It's beautiful.
I would very much like to see you in it.
[laughs]
I'll bet you would.
All right.
What do you got to drink around here?
We don't have much time.
Soon they will come to harm you, and I will not be able to stop them, unless you are able to give me something to placate them.
Some, uh, piece of information... which I can use to protect you from them.
I've already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
Marion, you are beautiful.
I don't think we need a chaperone.
[workers muttering]
[thunder rumbling]
SALLAH:
Steadily.
Steadily. Whoa!
Down...
Down-- Whoa.
Carefully, carefully!
You all right, Indy?
[hissing]
SALLAH: Now gently, boys.
Gently, gently!
[hissing]
[loud hiss]
[men scream]
Whoa...
[loud hissing]
[hissing]
[quiet whimper]
I told you it will be all right.
[laughs]

Huh...
[snarling hiss]
Sallah, get down here!

[heavy thud]
Oh, that's good.
[laughing]
[laughing drunkenly]
Whoops.
[laughing]
What is this stuff, Rene?
I grew up with this.
[laughing]
It's my family label.
[laughing]
[laughing]
[laughing]
Well... I have to be going now, Rene.
[laughing]
I like you, Rene, very much.
Perhaps we'll meet someday under better circumstances.
We meet again, Fraulein.
You Americans, you're all the same.
Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
[gasps]
[sighs]
Now... what shall we talk about?
[thunder rumbling]
[quiet creaking]
[low rumbling]
[harsh hissing]

INDIANA:
All right... take it up!
Easy!
[pulley squeaking]
DIETRICH: You're as stubborn as that girl.
TOHT: You like her too much, I think.
BELLOQ: Your methods of archaeology are too primitive for me.
You would use a bulldozer to find a... China cup.
Shliemann!
Wake your men!
Indy, the torches are burning out.
Go on, get out of here.
Hyah!
[yelling in German]
Sallah!
BELLOQ:
Hello!
Hello!
Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!
Thank you, my friend, but I think we are all very comfortable up here.
That's right, isn't it?
[officers chuckling]
Yes, we are very comfortable up here.
So, once again, Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine.
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.
You're about to become a permanent addition to this archaeological find.
Who knows?
In a thousand years, even you may be worth something.
[forced laugh]
Son of a bitch.
SHLIEMANN: I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr. Jones.
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.
But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place all alone.
MARION:
Slimy pig, you let me go!
Stop it!
[screams]
Marion!
Hang on.
[grunting]
Don't...
Indy!
Don't fall!
Marion, I got you!
I got you! I got you!
[screams]
[grunts]
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!
[hissing]
[gasps and whimpers]
[yelling]
[screaming]
Snakes!
[screaming]
Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!
[screaming]
BELLOQ:
The girl was mine!
She's of no use to us.
Only our mission for the fuehrer matters.
I wonder sometimes,
Monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind.
It was not to be, chÃ©rie.
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!
Indiana Jones... adieu.
[Toht laughing]
[stone lid rumbling]
No!
[thud echoing]
[hissing]
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.
MARION:
Thank you.
Oh, my God, this whole place is slithering.
Indy!
Ow! Jesus!
[hissing]
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
Well, where the hell were you?
Watch it, watch it.
What are you doing?!
For the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!
Well, whatever you're doing, do it faster.
[slithering]
Ah...
Where are you going?
Through that wall.
Just get ready to run, whatever happens to me.
What do you mean by that?
[hissing]
Indy!
Damn it! Don't you leave me down here by myself!
[rattling]
[reptilian screech]
[screaming]
[gasps]
[hissing]
[gasping]
[Marion gasping]
Indy!
Here we go!
Get ready!
Indy, the torch is going out!
[coughing]

Indy?

[eerie moaning]

[blood-curdling scream]
Marion!
Look. Look.
[panting]
[grunting]
[heavy thud]
[engines revving]
[man shouting in German]
They're going to fly it out of here.
When that Ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on the plane.
Ah, monsieur, let us toast our success in the desert.
To the Ark.
When we are very far from here.
That will do.
[speaking German]
[officer shouting in German]
[chuckles]
[laughs]
Hey, you now-- come here!
Come here!
[speaking German]
[shouting in German]

[groans loudly]

[Marion grunts]
Indy!
[all exclaiming]
Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!
Look out!
Oh, my God.
Marion.
MARION:
In here! Up here!
Indy, come on!
Hold on!
MARION: Move up!
It's gonna blow up!
It's stuck! Indy!
[mechanic grunting]
I can't push it off!
[speaks German]
[screams]
It's stuck!
Turn it! Turn it!
It's stuck!
Turn it there!
Never mind!
Get back! Get back!
Get the Ark away from this place immediately.
Have it put on the truck.
We'll fly it out of Cairo.
And Gobler, I want plenty of protection.
[Gobler speaks German]
Jones.
[workers clamoring]
[man whistles]
Holy smoke, my friends,
I... I'm so pleased you're not dead!
[explosion booms in distance]
Indy, Indy, we have no time.
If you still want the Ark, it is being loaded onto a truck for Cairo.
Truck?
What truck?
[workers clamoring angrily]
[gunfire]
Let's go!
Get back to Cairo.
Get us some transport to England-- boat, plane, anything.
Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.
I'm going after that truck.
How?
I don't know.
I'm making this up as I go.
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
[horse whinnies]
Hyah! Hyah!

[singing in native language]
Everything at last has been arranged.
The Ark?
Is on board.
Nothing is lacking, now that you're here.
Or what is left of you.
INDIANA:
You trust these guys?
Yes.
Mr. Katanga.
Mr. Katanga, these are my friends.
They are my family.
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.
My cabin is theirs.
Mr. Jones...
I've heard a lot about you, sir.
Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.
[both laughing]
Good-bye.
[groaning]
Look out for each other.
I am already missing you.
You're my good friend.
Sallah.
That is for Fayah... that is for your children... and this is for you.
[ship's horn blaring]
Thank you. âª A British tar is a soaring soul âª âª As free as a mountain bird âª âª His energetic fist should be ready to... âª
[laughter] âª ...a dictator...
[whistling happily]
Where did you go?
I'm cleaning up.
[groans]
Where'd you get that?
From him.
Who him?
Katanga.
I got a feeling
I'm not the first woman ever to travel with these pirates.
It's lovely.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
[loud thud]
[Indiana screams]
What'd you say?
[groans]
Wait... I don't need any help.
You know you do.
You're not the man
I knew ten years ago.
It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage.
You are...
Please, I don't need a nurse.
I just want to sleep.
Don't be such a baby.
Marion, leave me alone.
What is this here?
Go away.
Yes, it hurts.
Ow!
Well, goddamn it, Indy, where doesn't it hurt?
Here.
Here.
This isn't too bad.
Here.
[snoring]
Jones...
Jones?!
We never seem to get a break, do we?
[rats squeaking]
[deep, eerie pulsing hum]
[squeaking]
What is it?
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.
[door opens and shuts]
What's happening?
We have most important friends.
Holy shit.
[man speaking German over bullhorn]
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
Come on, go, go, go.
Come on, go, my friend, go.
[bell ringing]
[speaking German]
MAN:
Where is Dr. Jones?
MARION:
What's the big idea?
Let go!
Don't you touch me.
[Marion yells]
[speaking German]
[laughing]
What about Jones?
There's no trace yet, sir.
KATANGA:
Jones is dead.
I killed him.
He was of no use to us.
This girl, however, has certain value where we're headed.
She'll bring a very good price.
Mmm?
Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken-- if it's your goal, go in peace with it, but leave us the girl.
It would reduce our loss on this trip.
Savage!
You are not in the position to ask for anything.
We will take what we wish.
And then decide whether or not to blow your ship from the water.
The girl goes with me.
She'll be part of my compensation.
I'm sure your fuehrer would approve.
If she fails to please me, you may do with her as you wish.
I will waste no more time with her now.
Excuse me.
I can't find Mr. Jones,
Captain.
I've looked everywhere.
He's got to be here somewhere.
Look again.
I found him.
Where?
There.

The altar has been prepared in accordance with your radio instructions, sir.
Good.
Take the Ark there immediately.
Monsieur...
I am uncomfortable with the thought of this... Jewish ritual.
Are you sure it's necessary?
Let me ask you this:
Would you be more comfortable opening the Ark in Berlin, for your fuehrer?
Finding out, only then, if the sacred pieces of the Covenant are inside?
Knowing, only then, whether you have accomplished your mission, and obtained the one true Ark?
Hello!
Jones.
Jones!
I'm going to blow up the Ark, Rene.
Your persistence surprises even me.
You're going to give mercenaries a bad name.
Dr. Jones... surely you don't think you can escape from this island.
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be.
All I want is the girl.
If we refuse?
Then your fuehrer has no prize.
Okay, stand back.
All of you, stand back.
Stand back.
Okay, Jones.
You win!
Blow it up.
[yelling in German]
Yes, blow it up!
Blow it back to God.
All your life has been spent in pursuit of archaeological relics.
Inside the Ark are treasures beyond your wildest aspirations.
You want to see it open as well as I.
Indiana... we are simply passing through history.
This...
This is history.
Do as you will.
[thunder rumbling]
[speaking Hebrew]
[laughing]
[laughing continues]
[mysterious screeching]
[pulsating tone rumbling]
[eerie hissing]
Marion, don't look at it.
Shut your eyes, Marion.
Don't look at it, no matter what happens.
Ah...
[ethereal howling]
It's beautiful!
[growling]
[screaming]
Indy?
Don't look, Marion!
Keep your eyes shut!
[screaming]
[rumbling and whooshing]
[screaming]
[thunderclap]
Marion.
You've done your country a great service, and we thank you and we trust you found the settlement satisfactory.
Oh, the money's fine.
The situation's totally unacceptable.
Well, gentlemen,
I guess that just about wraps it up.
Where is the Ark?
I thought we'd settled that.
The Ark is somewhere very safe.
From whom?
The Ark is a source of unspeakable power and it has to be researched.
And it will be,
I assure you, Dr. Brody,
Dr. Jones.
We have top men working on it right now.
Who?
Top men.
Hey, what happened?
You don't look very happy.
Fools. Bureaucratic fools.
What'd they say?
They don't know what they've got there.
Well, I know what
I've got here.
Come on.
I'll buy you a drink.
You know... a drink?
