They came out in search of the thief
The stars came out
Yes, Saroo, my name is Mrs. Sood, come sit here
It's my job to make sure that there isn't a single kid here who should be somewhere else
That's why I'm here
People don't like me here
Look at this
We have been asking around about you for a long time
We have published it in the newspaper
In all the newspapers in Calcutta
15 million people read this paper that's a lot of people
But we haven't had a single reply
My home is really far
Not one reply
What about Mum?
No not even Mum
Guddu?
Saroo...
We have found a family over in Austral who want to look after you
Do you know where Australia is?
Would you like to see them?

A small island and everyone there is really nice

Aren't they?
Keep this with you and keep it safe, ok?
Saroo...
Son, you can't stay here
Did you really look for my mum?
Looked everywhere
You'll have a nice home
Australia is a great place
Does everybody have a napkin?
This is called a "serviette"
Serviette
Lay it down on your lap like this so that food doesn't fall on your clot
So it doesn't ruin them

Hey!
I'm all right.
This one.
We're gonna miss you.
Yeah.
It's only Melbourne.
Who is across the water?
Saroo...
Our beautiful boy!
May this bring you all that you could wish for.
Yeah, and then some.
Thanks mum. Thanks dad.
From the moment you came into our lives...
Mum...
No no no, let me finish.
From the moment you came into our lives...
You were all that we could have hoped for.
More, more than we hoped for, really.
And, er, more work, that's for sure.
You really embraced every opportunity.
We're very proud of you, son.
Very proud and very excited with this next chapter in your life.
To success!
Excuse me guys?
Are you still waiting on someone?
Or can I take this plate away?
Yeah, you can take it away.
No no no, you can leave it.
No, take it.
I'd like to keep it.
Thank you.
You don't really think he will turn up, do you?
No, just leave it, son.
That's a nice one.
Yeah it's a good one.
This one's a local one.
Mantosh?
Yeah...
Sorry, I didn't meet lunch.
What's that course again?
Hotel Management.
So you're going when to do what?
Manage a hotel!
Well... have fun!
Any bills you need to pay?
You can give us a job when you come back.
Please could you not do anything while I'm away?
Yeah Yeah... that's going to make mum more unhappy than you already do.
Mate...
Why do you think I stay away?
We see ourselves as United Nations of hospitality schools.
And we'd like to think we teach a global and balanced perspective.
You're here because you have a dream.
We're here to help make that dream a reality.
Yeah and I saw firsthand how the hospitality industry can really bring infrastructure to communities that need it.
But I also saw a lot of problems that they cause, which is why community groups need to be, involved every step of the way, and they need to be taken seriously.
And?
I guess I want to help facilitate that and help give them a voice.
Saroo.
I want to run hotels, so I put all the profits into my pocket.
Well, let me ask and start with where you are from? Shall we?
So, born in Australia?
Yeah No, er...
Calcutta.
I've got family in Calcutta.
My cousins are quite...
Which part?
I'm adopted. I'm not really Indian.
But you like cricket though, right?
Ah, you like cricket...
You go for the Aussies or the Indians?
Only the Aussies, mate!
Only the Aussies, mate!
This is going to be interesting.
Okay, Saroo...
Why did you choose this course?
What else do you want to get out of it?
Hi, Hey!
Welcome.
Come in. Come in.
Hi!
Hi, how are you?
Do you guys like Indian food?
That's all we have.
That's all we have.
It smells so great.
I tried to copy from someone...
You've ever done Bollywood dance?
Oh, just like, one leg.
Yeah, one leg...
Where I grew up, I say flashlight.
What do you say?
Lampo de poche.
Lampo de poche?
Flashlight
Flashlight
Lampo de poche.
Flashlight is er...(Indian word)
What do you say?
Torch.
If you want to eat with your hands, you need to use the naan, like a spoon.
Use a fork.
No, let him use the naan.
So how do you say taxi?
Taxi.
Taxi.
It is the same in every language.
Do you want a fork, Saroo?
Yeah!
He's like my father.
You want another beer?
Yes please, thank you.
Guddu, I want some jalebi.
Guddu, jalebis
Hello...
You okay?
Saroo?
I'm not from Calcutta.
I'm lost.
Howrah station is enormous, you must have been freaking out.
I once went through there on a pilgrimage to Puri, and I missed my connection twice.
And you didn't speak Bengali?
I didn't even know it was called that.
How long were you on the train?
A couple of days.
A couple of days?
Saroo, what was your hometown again?
Ganestlay.
I must have had it wrong because it doesn't exist.
But there must be something else that you do remember.
The platform...
I fell asleep on, there's a big rain tank.
It was only a few stops from Ganestlay.
There are thousands of stations with rain tanks.
Okay, it was a long time ago.
Have you heard of this new program, Google Earth?
It's incredible, you can find any place from anywhere.
Listen to me, we can find out how fast passenger trains went back then.
We take that speed, multiply by the hours that you were on the train.
That's it!
We create a search radius.
And inside there, you will find the station with the rain tank.
Yeah, but it will take a lifetime to search all the stations in India.
Did I say all the stations?
Ok, even half the stations..
Really guys,
I don't want to talk about this.
Did your parents try to find you?
What?
They tried to find him.
No I just mean like, if they tried to find him, maybe they left like a paper trail.
What paper trail?
He didn't know his surname.
My mum couldn't read or write.
What does she do?
A labourer, she carried rocks.
Your mum?
My mom died about four years ago now.
I'm sorry.
My dad is still so angry at her.
Not for getting sick, obviously... but just for refusing chemo.
But she just knew herself, you know?
She knew what her terms were and she knew how she wanted to live, so...
Just couldn't accept that, I guess.
And how do you feel?
I miss her.
And what do you think of
Bharat's search radius idea?
What was that?
Is that your dance?
Is that how you dance?
Oh, God!
Hey.
You can't keep going on like this.
Let me help you.
Let's go for a run.
What?
Lucy!
Come here.
Hold on.
Got a cramp.
You lied! You cheat.
I never show anybody this.
Okay, they're beautiful.
I do enjoy it.
My little hobby.
Oh wow, look at Mantosh!
Uh huh.
I'm so glad he's coming tonight.
Cheeky little thing.
Pure energy.
But incredible.
So sweet!
He's been hard to control, but... very, very smart... and very...
I mean, he could do anything if he just learned to control that energy.
He could do it, and do it all.
Saroo is very protective of him.
I've been blessed.
Very blessed.
Your mom showed me all your old little trophies.
Mum, you didn't.
I didn't know you were so athletic.
That's only half of them.
There's plenty more in the garage.
Hey, where you going, mate?
Finishing my smoke.
I can barely get him off... the couch these days.
Lucy!
Why can't you just tell them... what you've been up to?
Don't!
Tell us.
They will understand and they will support you.
What? Come on.
Hey, um, dinner!
Better eat it, while it's hot.
You hungry?
Yeah.
What?
What have I missed?
Nothing.
She looks upset.
She's not upset!
You and I are leaving.
Saroo knows everything.
He's an expert.
Uh oh!
He's a manager.
Why are you here?
He's here because he's your brother.
No, he's not.
We're different.
Hey, now now, Saroo!
Saroo...
All right.
It's all right.
Hey hey, no no...
It's all right, It's all right...
Stop!
Don't move.
It's okay.
Nice one, mate.
It's okay mate, It's okay, just breathe, mate. Just breathe...
I hate what he's done to you.
I'm sorry.
Saroo!
Saroo.
Saroo!
Saroo!
Hey!
Hey...
Kiss me.
Stop, please.
Hey!
Look at me.
Look at me!
Can this wait?
Where are you?
Can this wait 'til we get home?
Yah?
Home?
What home?
You mean, where I'm alone in one room and you're alone in another room?
Come on.
Stop, Luce. Stop it.
Come on.
Please.
Saroo!
You need to face reality!
What do you mean? Reality?
You have any idea what it's like knowing my real brother... and mother spend everyday of their lives looking for me?
How every day my real brother screams my name!
Can you imagine the pain they must be in for not knowing where I am?
25 years, Luce.
Why didn't you tell me that's was happening for you?
And we swung about in our... privileged lives.
It makes me sick.
I have to find home.
They need to know, okay?
I've never stopped you.
I want to help.
I can't do this anymore.
You deserve more.
Don't you do that!
Don't you dare do that!
This is on you, not on me.
Saroo, you there, mate?
It's One Day International
(cricket) tomorrow.
You can come over if you like?
I meant to tell you,
I fixed the tiller.
Why don't we take her out?
We can head up the coast?
Hey, Saroo...
Mate, your mum's not, um, look, we've lost track of Mantosh, he's missing again.
You know how worried she gets.
We know you quit your job, mate.
Just worried about you, son.
I've been visiting her.
Every night I walk those streets home.
Home from the dam.
Home from the station.
I know now... every single step of the way.
And I imagine that I'm... whispering in her ear...
I'm here, it's alright.
What was she like?
Beautiful.
How was New York?
It's the same.
So, what brings you back?
My funding came through.
It's great!
See...
They know how good you are.
I miss you.
I saw your mom.
She's not doing very well.
I'm worried, it would kill her if she knew I was searching.
You underestimate her.
She needs you.
No, give me five rupees then I'll carry them all
Okay, you win, take this
He was carrying a watermelon and didn't see it coming
What?
What if you do find home and they're not even there?
And you never stop and keep searching?
And you don't know what happens over time, things change, and entire worlds change.
I don't have a choice.
Stay.
I can't.
Stay right there
Weren't you supposed to look after him?
Where were you?
Don't you love him?
John heard Mantosh is out on the boats.
Doing a lobster run.
He's due back tomorrow.
So he'll be flushed with cash, back on the hard stuff.
I'm sorry you couldn't have your own kids.
What are you saying?
We...
We... weren't blank pages, were we?
Like your own would have been.
You weren't just adopting us but our past as well.
I feel like, we're killing you.
I could have had kids.
What?
We chose not to have kids.
We wanted the two of you.
That's what we wanted.
We wanted the two of you in our lives.
That's what we chose.
That's one of the reasons,
I fell in love with your dad.
Because we both felt, as if... the world has enough people in it.
Have a child, couldn't guarantee it will make anything better.
But to take a child that's suffering like you boys were.
Give you a chance in the world.
That's something.
I bet you never imagined it being this hard.
It's not a matter of hard.
It's not a mat...
There's only one path for me.
And, that's how I think.
That's how this happened because...
When I was 12,
I had a vision.
Some people would say, it was a breakdown. But it...
My dad was an alcoholic.
You know that, and he was like he wasn't a good man.
He was out of control when I was...
I was standing at the back of the house.
I was looking out across this field.
And I just wanted the earth to swallow me up.
And I...
I felt an electric current, it was like a shock, like a jolt through my whole body.
And then I saw...
A brown skinned child across that field.
And he was standing beside me.
And it was right there and I could feel it so strongly.
And for the first time in my life I felt something good...
I felt good.
And I knew it was guiding me.
And I knew that
I was going to be fine.
It was, as if, that moment I could see my future, right there!
Because I always thought that
I could keep this family together.
And now...
Now I don't know.
Where...
Mum...
What's happening? I don't understand.
You don't talk to me any more.
I need you, Saroo.
Mantosh!
Sorry for what I said at dinner.
Ganesh Talai...
Ganesh Talai.
Ganestlay!
Mum
I found home!
What?
Please wait for me.
I'm here.
So this is where you've been.
I don't want you to feel,
I was ungrateful.
There wasn't a day,
I didn't want to tell you.
Saroo.
I really hope she's there.
She needs to see how beautiful you are!
Hey
Hi, I used to live here.
I... used to...
Can I help?
That's me. I'm Saroo.
I used to live here.
You lived here?
Yes I used to live here.
I'm looking for Guddu,
Kallu, Shekila.
My mother.
Come.
Come where?
Come with me.
Just come.
Saroo!
Mum.
Mum?
Saroo?
Saroo...
Saroo!
Saroo!
Oh, how I looked for you!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Yes, the watermelon.
Watermelon
Tarabuja!
Yes, Tarabuja!
Watermelon...
Guddu?
And Guddu?
Where is Guddu?
Where is he?
Guddu is no more.
He is with God.
Shekila.
Shekila
Shekila
Shekila?
Shekila?
Shekila?
He's your brother!
She's so big!
It's me, Saroo.
Beautiful.
Hi, mum.
I know you will be sound asleep.
I just want to say that I'm safe.
I'm safe and the questions have been answered.
There are no more dead-ends.
I found my mother, and... she thanks you both for raising me.
She understands that you are my family.
She's... happy, just knowing I'm alive.
I found her, but that doesn't change who you are.
I love you mum... so much.
And you, Dad.
And Mantosh.
C'mon!
Let's go!
Come on!
Saroo!
Let's go!
Walk faster!
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!
