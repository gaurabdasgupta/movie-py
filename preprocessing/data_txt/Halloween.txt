Ever done anything like this before?
Only minimum security.

DOCTOR: The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
WOMAN: The only thing that ever bothers me is their jibberish.
When they start raving on and on.
You don't have anything to worry about.
He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
WOMAN:
Are there any special instructions?
DOCTOR: Just try to understand what we're dealing with here.
Don't underestimate it.
Don't you think we could refer to it as him?
If you say so.
Your compassion's overwhelming, doctor.
What do I give him when we take him in front of the judge?
Thorazine.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
That's the idea.
WOMAN:
You're serious about it, aren't you?
DOCTOR:
Yeah.
You mean you actually never want him to get out?
Never, never...
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
Never.
Why are we taking him up to Hardin County if we just gonna walk--
Because that is the law.
Here we are.
WOMAN: Since when did they let them wander around?
Pull up to the main gate.
Shouldn't we put--?
Go on, move.
Stop here.
Shouldn't we go on up to the hospital ins--
Wait.

Will you read to me?
Can we make popcorn?
Sure, sure, sure.
[TOMMY GIGGLING]
LAURIE:
You better hurry up.
TOMMY: How come you're walking to school this way?
LAURIE:
My dad asked me to.
TOMMY:
Why?
LAURIE: I have to drop off a key.
TOMMY: Why?
LAURIE:
Because he's gonna sell a house.
TOMMY: Why?
LAURIE: Because that's his job.
TOMMY:
Where?
LAURIE:
The Myers' house.
TOMMY:
The Myers' house?
You're not supposed to go up there.
Yes, I am.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
Just watch.
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
Lonnie Elamb said never to go up there.
Lonnie Elamb said that's a haunted house.
He said awful stuff happened there once.
Lonnie Elamb probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
TOMMY:
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
Bye.
Bye.
I wish I had you all alone
[MAN BREATHING HEAVILY]
Just the two of us
I would hold you close to me
So close
Just the two of us
I'm not responsible, Sam.
Oh, no.
I told them how dangerous he was--
Roadblocks and an all-points bulletin...
...wouldn't stop a 5-year-old.
He was your patient. if precautions weren't strong, you should have said so.
I told everybody. Nobody listened.
There's nothing else I can do.
You can get back there and get back on the telephone.
Tell them exactly who walked out last night.
And tell them exactly where he's going.
Probably going.
I'm wasting my time.
Sam, Haddonfield is 150 miles away from here.
Now, for God's sakes, he can't drive a car.
He was doing very well last night.
Maybe someone around here gave him lessons.
[CAR ENGINE STARTING]
WOMAN [ON PA]:
Dr. Chance, please report to Ward C.
Dr. Chance, Ward C, please.
TEACHER:
And the book ends.
But what Samuels is really talking about here is fate.
You see, fate caught up with several lives here.
No matter what course of action
Collins took...
...he was destined to his own fate...
...his own day of reckoning with himself.
The idea is that destiny...
...is a very real, concrete thing...
...that every person has to deal with.
How does Samuels' view of fate differ from that of Costaine's?
Laurie?
Ma'am?
TEACHER: Answer the question.
Oh, um, Costaine wrote that fate was somehow related only to religion...
...whereas Samuels felt that, well, fate was like a natural element...
...like earth, air, fire and water.
TEACHER:
That's right.
Samuels definitely personified fate.
In Samuels' writing, fate is immovable, like a mountain.
It stands where man passes away.
Fate never changes.

You need a shopping cart to get home.
[LYNDA LAUGHING]
GIRLS:
Hey, Haddonfield.
LAURIE:
Yeah, not funny.
You know, it's totally insane.
We have three new cheers to learn in the morning...
...the game is in the afternoon,
I have to get my hair done at 5...
...and the dance is at 8.
I'll be totally wiped out.
I don't think you have enough to do.
Totally.
As usual, I have nothing to do.
It's your own fault and I don't feel a bit sorry for you.
ANNIE:
Hey, Lynda, Laurie.
Why didn't you wait for me?
We did. Fifteen minutes, you totally never showed.
ANNIE:
That's not true. Here I am.
What's wrong, Annie?
You're not smiling.
I'm never smiling again.
Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me--
Exploring uncharted territory?
It's been totally charted.
We just talked.
Sure, sure.
Sure. Mm-hm.
Old jerk-o got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows.
His parents grounded him.
He can't come over tonight.
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
LYNDA: Only reason she babysits is to have a place--
Shit.
I have a place for that.
I forgot my chemistry book.
So who cares? I always forget my chemistry book.
And my math book, and my English book, and my, let's see, my French book and...
Oh, who needs books anyway?
I don't need books.
I always forget all of my books.
I mean, it doesn't really matter if you have your books or not.
LYNDA:
Hey, isn't that Devon Graham?
I don't think so.
I think he's cute.
ANNIE:
Hey, jerk.
Speed kills.
[CAR BREAKING]
God, can't you take a joke?
You know, Annie, someday, you're going to get us all into deep trouble.
Totally.
I hate a guy with a car and no sense of humor.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
I wouldn't wanna get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Oh, come on, Annie.
Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
All right.
The Wallaces leave at 7.
I'm babysitting the Doyles.
It's only three houses down.
We can keep each other company.
Oh, terrific. I've got three choices.
Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw around, or talk to you.
ANNIE:
I am so mad.

Saving the treats for Bob?
Funny. See you.
Bye.
Bye.
[BOTH SIGH]
Annie, look.
Look where?
LAURIE:
Behind the bush.
I don't see anything.
The guy who drove by so fast, that one you yelled at.
Oh, subtle, isn't he?
Hey, creep.
Laurie, dear, he wants to talk to you.
He wants to take you out tonight.
He was standing right there.
Poor Laurie.
You scared another one away.
It's tragic. You never go out.
You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Guys think I'm too smart.
I don't, I think you're whacko.
Now you're seeing men behind bushes.
Well, home sweet home.
See you later.

You scared me to death.
I had my mouth full.
Couldn't you hear me?
Thought it was an obscene phone call.
Now, you hear obscene chewing.
You're losing it, Laurie.
I already lost it.
I doubt that.
Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up, 6:30.
Okay, bye.

[CAR RADIO

Hurry up.
Hi.
[LAURIE GRUNTS]
Just have time.
Yeah, Judith Myers. Myers...
"Row 18, plot 20."
DOCTOR:
Hm.
Yeah, you know, you know, every town has something like this happen.
I remember over in Russellville, old Charly Bowles, about 15 years ago.
One night, he finished dinner, and excused himself from the table.
And he went out to the garage.
He got himself a hacksaw.
And then he went back into the house...
...and he kissed his wife and his two children goodbye...
...and then he proceeded--
DOCTOR: Where are we?
MAN: Huh?
Oh, it's right over here.
Yeah, Myers, Judith Myers.
I remember her.
Couldn't believe it.
Such a young boy.
DOCTOR:
What's the matter, are you lost?
MAN:
Why do they do it? Goddamn kids.
They'll do anything for Halloween.
Whose grave is it?
Oh, I don't know. Uh...
Eighteen, 19...
Judith Myers.
He came home.
You still spooked?
I wasn't spooked.
Lies.
I wasn't.
I saw somebody standing in Mr. Riddle's backyard.
Probably Mr. Riddle.
He's watching me.
Mr. Riddle was watching you?
Laurie, Mr. Riddle is 87.
LAURIE:
He can still watch.
ANNIE:
That's probably all he can do.
What's the pumpkin for?
I brought it for Tommy.
I figured carving a jack-o'-lantern would keep him occupied.
I always said you'd make a fabulous Girl Scout.
Thanks.
And for that matter, I might as well be a Girl Scout myself tonight.
I plan on making popcorn and watching Dr. Dementia.
Six straight hours of horror movies.
Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
[COUGHING]
My dad. Get rid of this.

ANNIE:
Laurie, stop coughing.
What's the matter with you? Jesus.
Just be natural. There he is.
Just be natural, Laurie.
Hi, Annie, Laurie.
Hi.
Hi, Dad, what happened?
MR. BRACKETT: What?
What happened?
Oh, uh, somebody broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
You blame everything on kids.
Well, all they took was some Halloween masks...
...uh, rope, and a couple of knives.
Now, who do you think it was?
It's hard growing up with a cynical father.
MR. BRACKETT: Aren't you late--?
Huh?
I said aren't you gonna be late?!
He shouts too.
Bye, girls.
Bye, Dad.
Bye.
Sheriff?
Pardon me, I'm, uh, Loomis.
Dr. Sam Loomis.
Uh, Lee Brackett.
I'd like to have a word with you if I could.
Maybe a few minutes.
I gotta take care--
it's important.
Ten minutes.
I'll be here.
What's the matter with you?
I think he knew.
I'm sure he could smell it.
No, he didn't.
Did.
See the look on his face?
He always looks like that.
What are you gonna wear to the dance tomorrow?
I didn't know you thought about things like that, Laurie.
You know, you could ask somebody.
Oh, I couldn't.
Sure you could. All you have to do is go up to somebody and say:
"You wanna go to the dance?"
You could do that. I couldn't.
Well, you could ask Dick Baxter.
He'd go out with you.
[ANNIE LAUGHING]
I'd rather go out with Ben Tramer.
Ben Tramer?
I knew it. So you do think about things like that, huh, Laurie?
[GIGGLES]
Shut up.
He's cute.

What is that?
LEE [NORMAL VOICE]:
It's a dog.

He got hungry.
Come on. Could've been a skunk.
Could have.
A man wouldn't do that.
This isn't a man.

It happened in here.
She was sitting right here.
He could have seen her through this window.
Standing on the lawn, he could have seen inside.
[GUN COCKS]
Huh, you must see me a very sinister doctor.
[LAUGHS]
Oh, um, I do have a permit.
Seems to me you're just plain scared.
Yes. Yeah, I am, uh...
I met him 15 years ago.
I was told there was nothing left.
No reason, no, uh, conscience, no understanding...
...in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death, of good or evil...
...of right or wrong.
I met this 6-year-old child...
...with this blank, pale, emotionless face...
...and the blackest eyes.
The devil's eyes.
I spent eight years trying to reach him.
And then another seven trying to keep him locked up...
...because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes...
...was purely and simply evil.
What do we do?
He's been here once tonight.
I think he'll come back.
I'm gonna wait for him.
I should notify the radio and television--
No.
If you do that, they'll see him on every street corner...
...look for him in every house.
Just tell your men to keep their mouths shut and their eyes open.
I'll check back in an hour.
"'How now, ' cried Arthur.
'Let no one pass this way without a fight.'

Why do you keep them under there?

"Neutron Man. " I can understand why.
"Tarantula Man."

What would you say if I told you that you were going...
...to the homecoming dance tomorrow night?
I'd probably say you have the wrong number.
[GIGGLES]
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer, and he got real excited...
...when I told him how attracted you were to him.
LAURIE:
Oh, Annie.
Oh, you didn't.
Please tell me you didn't.
How could you do that?
I mean how can you just call him...
[KIDS LAUGHING]
What do you mean it was easy?
I can't believe this.
I can't tell you anything.

I'm not mad.
Please tell me you didn't.
Oh, you didn't.

I couldn't even face him.
Laurie, he's out there.
Hold on.

Go watch TV.
It's just Tommy.
Oh, please, tell me you didn't.
How could you do that?

Look, it's simple.
You like him, he likes you.
All you need is a little push.

Do you believe everything

No.

I saw the bogeyman. I saw him outside.
There was nobody outside.
There was.
What did he look like?
The bogeyman.
We're not getting anywhere.
All right. The bogeyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?

Yeah, but I've seen you stuck in plenty of other positions.

Oh, that's fabulous.
When did they leave?
About a half-hour ago.
Oh, utterly fantastic.
So why don't you just walk over?
Come and pick me up.
Oh, I can't come now.
My clothes are in the wash.
You won't need them.
Oh, shut up, jerk.
God, I've got a shirt on.
That's all you ever think about.
I think that's all you ever think about.
That's no true.
I think about lots of things.
Why don't we not stand here talking about them...
...and get down to doing them?

Well, come on, get your coat.
We're going to pick up Paul.
I don't want to.

This has not been my night.

Got stuck in the laundry room.
I'll tell you something.
Call Ben Tramer and tell him that you were fooling.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
No, he went drinking with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back till late.
You'll have to call him tomorrow.
Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
Wait a minute.
If you watch her, I'll consider talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Deal.

...trick-or-treating, parking, getting high.
I have the feeling that you're way off on this.
You have the wrong feeling.
You're not doing very much to prove me wrong.
What more do you need?
Well, it's gonna take more than fancy talk...
...to keep me up all night crawling around these bushes.
I watched him for 15 years, sitting in a room, staring at a wall...
...not seeing the wall, looking past the wall...
...looking at this night, inhumanly patient.
Waiting for some secret silent alarm to trigger him off.
Death has come to your little town, sheriff.
You can either ignore it or you can help me to stop it.
More fancy talk.
Doctor, do you know what Haddonfield is?
Families, children, all lined up in rows up and down these streets.
You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
They could be.
All right, I'll stay with you tonight just on the chance that you're right.
And if you are right, damn you for letting him go.
[SNIFFS THEN GIGGLES]
Okay, so we're gonna--
First we go inside, right?
Then we'll just talk a little.
Then Annie will distract Lindsey, that's when we go upstairs...
...to the first bedroom on the left.
You got it?
Okay, first I rip your clothes off.
No, don't rip my blouse.
It's expensive, idiot.
Then you rip my clothes off.
Then we rip Lindsey's clothes off.
Yeah, I think I got it.
Totally.
[GIGGLES]
[LYNDA GIGGLING]
LYNDA:
No, no.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
Bob, put me down.
Put me down. This is totally silly.
Put me down.
Hey, it's totally dark.
Yeah.
Hey, Annie.
Annie, we're here.
I wonder where they went.
Oh, Annie probably took Lindsey out for something.
[DOOR SHUTS]
Hey, let's look for a note.
Let's don't.
[MOANING]
[HOWLING]
KIDS:
Ooh...
He's gonna get you.
No, he's not.
Hey, nobody's getting anybody.
Stop scaring each other.
Everybody's having a good time tonight.
All right, you guys, what's next?
Let's make more popcorn.
No, we've had enough.
Why don't we watch the rest of the movie?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
LAURIE:
Oh.
Doyle house.
Hi, Laurie. What's up?
Uh, I'm just sitting down for the first time tonight.
[LYNDA GIGGLES]
Hey, is Annie around?
No. I thought she'd be home by now.
She went to pick up Paul.
Well, she's totally not here.
She probably stopped off someplace.
Have her call me when she gets home.
I have Lindsey here and I wanna know what time to put her to bed.
Okay. Later.
Have a good time.
We definitely will.
Bye.
Lindsey is gone for the night.
Hey, now that's wonderful.

[TELEPHONE RINGING]
Oh, shit. Not again.
I can't help it. The phone keeps ringing.
Oh, and I can't keep you interested?
Just answer the damn phone.
Well, I can't. What if it's the Wallaces?
We'd get Annie in trouble, you know.
We'll just take it off the hook.
[MOANING AND PANTING]
Oh, fantastic.
[LYNDA SIGHS]
Totally.
Yeah.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Is that all you can say?
Yeah.
Go get me a beer.
I thought you were gonna get me one.
Yeah?
[GIGGLES]
I'll be right back.
Don't get dressed.

[MOANS]
[SIGHS]
Annie?
Paul?
Lynda, you asshole.
Okay, Lynda. Come on out.
[GRUNTING]
Well, did you get my beer?
[CHUCKLES]
Cute, Bob. Real cute.
See anything you like?
What's the matter?
Can't I get your ghost, Bob?
[LAUGHING]
All right, all right.
Come on, where's my beer?
Well, can't you answer me?
Okay, don't answer me.
Boy, are you weird.
Well, I'm gonna call Laurie.
I wanna know where Paul and Annie are.
This is going nowhere.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
Finally.
Hello?
[GASPS AND MOANS]
Hello?
[LYNDA MOANING ON PHONE]
All right, Annie.
First, I get your famous chewing, now I get your famous squealing?
Annie, are you all right?
[GRUNTS]
[LYNDA CHOKING]
Are you fooling around again?
I'll kill you if this is a joke.
LAURIE [ON PHONE]:

Bob?
All right, Annie.

This most definitely stopped being funny. Now, cut it out.
You'll be sorry.

Get upstairs, get Lindsey, lock the bedroom door.
I'm scared.
Do as I say.
The bogeyman--
Hurry!
[TAPPING ON PHONE]
Oh, no.
[CRYING]
Please stop.
Please.
[CRYING]
Where were you?
I went to the Myers' house--
I found the car. He's here.
Where?
He's three blocks down.
You go around the back of the houses.
I'll watch the front.
Go on.
All right.
Tommy? Lindsey?
Babies.
We're gonna take a little walk.
Was it the bogeyman?
I'm scared.
There's nothing to be scared of.
Are you sure?
TOMMY:
How?
I killed him.
You can't kill the bogeyman.

Now, just listen to me.
I want you to go down the stairs and out the front door.
I want you to go down the street to the Mackenzies' house.
I want you to tell them to call the police and tell them to send them over here.
Laurie...
Now, do you understand me?
Go, do as I say.
