<i>[ Ripley]
I keep seeing corn bread.</i>
I am cold.
Still with us, Brett?
<i>Right.</i>
<i>Oh, /fee/ dead.</i>
Anybody ever tell you you look dead, man?
[ <i>Mouthing Words</i> ]
<i>[Parker] Oh, yeah, r/jght.</i>
Now, I just forgot something, man.
Before we dock,
<i>I think we oughta discuss the bonus situation.</i>
<i>Fï¬ght. Brett and I, we think we oughta-</i>
We deserve full shares, right, baby?
You see, Mr. Parker and I... feel that the bonus situation has never been on an equitable level.
Well, you'll get what you're contracted for like everybody else.
Yes, but everybody else gets more than us.
<i>[</i> Mon/for Beep/ng <i>]</i>
Dallas, Mother wants to talk to you.
Huh? Yeah, I saw it. Yellow light's for my eyes only.
Okay, get dressed, huh?

Thank you.
It's the only thing good on this ship.

What the hell are you talking about?
That's not our system.
I know that.
<i>[Loud Rumb/ing ]</i> [ Parker] Do you ever notice how they never come down here?
I mean, this is where the work is, right?
Well, it's the same damn reason we get a half share to their one.
Our time is their time.
That's the way they see it.
No, but- Listen, man.
Same old shit, man.
I think I know why they don't come down here.
It's because of you.
You don't have no personality.
<i>Wonder what they want now.
What's going on down here?</i>
Um, you happen to be in my seat.
Can I have it? Yes, of course.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
<i>[ Wiping]</i>
<i>[ Parker]
What's happenin' now, baby?</i>
Well, some of you may have figured out we're not home yet.
We're only halfway there.
What?
Mother's interrupted the course of our journey.
Why?
<i>Yeah.</i>
She's programmed to do that should certain conditions arise. They have.
<i>[Rip/er] Like what?
It seems she has...</i> intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
<i>She go!</i> us <i>up lo check it' out.
</i> A <i>transmission? Out</i> here?
<i>Yeah.</i>
What kind of a transmission?
Acoustical beacon. It repeats at intervals of 12 seconds.
S.O.S.?
I don't know.
Human?
U n <i>kn own</i> . <i>[ Brett]
Well, so what?</i>
[ Kane] We are obligated under section eight-
I hate to bring this up, but, uh, this is a commercial ship, not a rescue ship.
Right. And it's not in my contract to do this kind of duty.
And what about the money? If you wanna give me some money, I'll be happy to oblige.
The man's right. Let's go over the bonus situation.
<i>I'm</i> sorry. <i>Can</i> I <i>say something?</i>
<i>Let's talk about the bonus more.</i>
There is a clause in the contract which specifically states... any systematized transmission indicating a possible intelligent origin... must be investigated.
I don't wanna hear it.
We don't know if it's intelligent.
I wanna go home and party.
Parker, will you just listen to the man?
On penalty of total forfeiture of shares. No money.
You got that?
[ Chuckling] Well, yeah.
All right, we're going in.
Yeah. We're goin' in, aren't we?

We gotta reroute all these ducts, and in order to do that we've got to dry-dock.

Keep the line open. Let's go.
Hey, Ripley.
Hey, Ripley,
I wanna ask you a question.
If they find what they're lookin' for out there, does that mean we get full shares?
Don't worry, Parker. You'll get whatever's coming to you.
Look, I'm not gonna do any more work... till we get this straightened out.
Brett', you're guaranteed by law to get a share.
[Parker] <i>What'?</i>
Why don't you just fuck off.
What?
<i>[ Brett] _
What'd you say, RIP?</i>
If you have any trouble,
I'll be on the bridge.
<i>[ Parker]

<i>[ Clicks Switch]

All right.
Have you tried putting that transmission through E.C.l.U.?

[ Lambert]
What is it?
Let's get out of here.
[ Kane] We've got this far.
We must go on.
We have to go on.
Will you say that again?
Shit.

Amazing.

<i>I 7n gonna go out' after them-</i>

What the hell is this?
The cave is completely enclosed, and it's full of... leathery objects, like eggs or something.

Ripley. We're clean. Let us in.

What happened to Kane?
Something has attached itself to him.
We have to get him to the infirmary right away.
What kind of thing?
<i>I need a clear definition.</i> An <i>organism.
Open the</i> hatch.
Wait a minute. If we let it in, the ship could be infected.
You know the quarantine procedure-
24 hours for decontamination.
He could die in 24 hours.
Open the hatch.
Listen to me. If we break quarantine, we could all die.
Look, would you open the goddamn hatch?
We have to get him inside.
No. I can't do that.
<i>And if you were in my position, you'd do the same.</i>
Ripley, this is an order.
Open that hatch right now.
Do you hear me?
Yes.
<i>Ripley, this is an order!
Do you hear me?</i>
Yes, I read you.
The answer is negative.
Inner hatch opened.
[Whirring]
My God.
What the hell is that?
How is he?
How are we gonna get that off him?
How are we gonna get it off? I'm gonna get some instruments.
My God.
Right.
<i>I'll</i> make an incision here.
Try and remove one of the digitals from- You're gonna do what?
Finger. I'm gonna try and get his finger off.
Just a minute.
[ Continues, indistinct]
<i>No, that's not- it's tearing his scalp. I know!</i>
It's not coming off without tearing his face off with it.
We'll have to take a look at him inside. Right.
How come they don't freeze him?
<i>[ Parker Shouting] How come you guys don 'z' freeze him ?</i>
All right, you can take your mask off.
<i>What's</i> it <i>got</i> down <i>his throat?
I would suggest ifs feeding him oxygen.</i>
Paralyzes him, puts him in a coma, then keeps him alive.
<i>Now what the hell is that?</i>
We gotta get it off of him.
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
I mean, let's not be too hasty.
We don't know anything aboutâ
<i>it.</i>
<i>Now, we 're assuming ifs feeding him oxygen.
If we remove iz',</i> it could kill him.
I'm willing to take that chance.
Let's cut it off him now.
You'll take responsibility? Yes, I'll take responsibility. Get him out of there.
<i>[ Dallas ]
Where do you wanna do this?</i>
We'll make an incision just below the knuckle there.
Right here.
<i>Stand</i> by.
[Whirring]
<i>[ Ash ]
Good God!</i>
<i>[ Dallas ] That crap's gonna eat through the hull.</i>
That thing's gonna eat through the goddamn hull. Come on!
What's going on?
This way.
<i>Next deck.</i>
<i>[ Sizzling ]</i>
<i>[ Parker ] There it' is.</i>
Don't get under it!
Don't get under it.
Looks like it's stopping.
Take a look at this, man. Yeah.
Brett, give me- What do you got, a pen there?
Give it to me, quick.
Come on! Come on!
<i>[ Brett]
Don't get any on your arm.</i>
It stopped.
Don't see anything like that except, uh, molecular acid.
It must be using it for blood.
It's got a wonderful defense mechanism.
<i>You don't dare kill it.</i>
What about Kane?
Here's your <i>pen</i> back.
<i>[Brett] What do we do now?</i>
Leave Kane to Ash.
You get back to work.
Well, what-
[ Electrical Crackling ]
Okay.
Try <i>it.
[Motor Gran/ring ]</i>
Damn it. I thought sure that was it.
Try it again.
[ Cranking ]
I feel like I've been in this place a month.
We shouldn't have landed in this place in the first place.
Shouldn't have landed on this damn ball, I know that.
Well, the sooner we patch this thing up and get out of here, the sooner we can go home.
This place gives me the creeps.
<i>[ Ripley]
That's amazing. What is it?</i>
Ah, yes, it is.
Um-
I don't know yet.
[ Coughs ]
Did you want something?
Yes. I, uh-
I'd like to have a little talk.
How's, uh- How's Kane?
He's holding.
No changes.
And, uh, our guest?
Well-
Hmm?
Well, as I said,
I'm still... collating, actually, but, uh,
I have confirmed that he's got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides.
He has a funny habit of shedding his cells... and replacing them with... polarized silicon, which gives him a prolonged resistance... to adverse environmental conditions.
Is that enough for you?
That's plenty.
What does it mean? Please don't do that.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Well, it's an interesting combination of elements, making him a tough little son of a bitch.
And you let him in.
I was obeying a direct order, remember?
Ash, when Dallas and Kane are off the ship,
I'm senior officer.
<i>Oh, yes. I forgot.</i>
You also forgot the science division's basic quarantine law.
No, that I didn't forget.
Oh, I see.
You just broke it.
Huh?
Look, what would you have done with Kane? Hmm?
You knew his only chance of survival was to get him in here.
Unfortunately, by breaking quarantine, you risk everybody's life.
Maybe I should've left him outside.
Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us, but it was a risk I was willing to take.
That's a pretty big risk... for a science officer.
It's, uh, not exactly out of the manual, is it?
I do take my responsibilities as seriously as you, you know.
<i>You do your job...</i> and let me do mine, yes?
<i>[ Wind Swirling] âªâª [ Classical]</i>

Ripley, meet me in the infirmary right away.
<i>[ Ripley]

<i>[ Ash ] Well, I don't know. I mean, we ought to try and find it.</i>
<i>[ Dallas ]
Yeah, let's check it.</i>
[Slow Breaths]
Dallas, please be careful.
[ Loud Crash ]
[ Gasps ]
Sorry.
No, not in the corner.
Psst. Have one of these.
<i>Just in case.</i>
Kane? Dallas?

You okay? I didn't see it.
Was it in the overhead?
What? It was up there somewhere.
My God.
<i>[ Dal/as ] Cover up the damn thing!
[Ash] Wait.</i>
That's alive!
That's a reflex action.
Well, we've gotta have a look at this.
Excuse me.
<i>[Ash</i> ] <i>Seems dead enough. [ R/jo/e y ] Well, good.
Let's gel' rid of/z'.</i>
Ripley, for God's sake, this is the first time that we've encountered a species like this.
<i>It has to go back. All sorts of tests have to be made.</i>
Ash, are you kidding?
This thing bled acid.
Who knows what it's gonna do when it's dead.
Think it's safe to assume it isn't a zombie.
Dallas, it has to go back.
Well, I'd soon... as not burn it at the stake, but you're the science officer.
It's your decision, Ash.
Dallas.
How come I've got to change my mind?
The decision's been made.
I'm not trying to change your mind, Dallas.
I just want you to listen-
Will you listen to-
[Groans]
<i>Just tel/ me how you can lea ve that kind of decision to him.</i>
Look, I just run the ship.
Anything that has to do with the science division, Ash has the final word.
How does that happen?
It happens, my dear, because that's what the company wants to happen.
Since when is that standard procedure?
Standard procedure is to do what the hell they tell you to do.
Did you ever ship out with Ash before?
I went out five times with another science officer.
They replaced him two days before we left Thedus with Ash. Hmm?
I don't trust him.
I don't trust anybody.
<i>What's happening with the repairs? How's it going?
Theywe pretty much fimshed new.</i>
Why the hell didn't you tell me so?
Because there's still some things left to do.
Like what?
<i>Well, we're blind on âBâ and âCâ decks.</i>
<i>The reserve power system's blown-
That's a bunch oi horseshâ.</i>

He can always get to a doctor when we get back home.
Right.
Whenever he says anything, you say âright,â Brett. You know that?
Right.
[Sighs]
Parker, what do you think? Your staff just follows you around, says âright.â
Just like a regular parrot.
Yeah. Shape up.
What are you, some kind of parrot?
Right.
Come on. Knock it off! Kane's gonna have to go into quarantine.
That's it.
Yes, and so will we.
Well, how about a little something to lower your spirits?
Thrill me, will you, please?
Well, according to my calculations, based on time spent getting to and from the planet-
Just give me the short version.
How far to Earth? Ten months.
Oh, God.
Great.
<i>[ Monitor Buzzes ]
Yes.</i>
<i>[ Ash ] Dallas, I think you should come and see Kane.</i>

Um, terrific.

Oh, thank you.
Do you remember anything about the planet?
What's the last thing you do remember?
Huh?
[Sighs]
I remember some... horrible dream about... smothering.
<i>And-</i>
And- Anyway, where are we?
Right here.
We're on our way home.
Back to the old freezerinos.
Could I have something to eat before we go back?
L-I need something myself.
Yeah, right. One more meal before bedtime.
I'm buyin'.
<i>Hey, that's</i> a break.
<i>Bedtime.</i>
[ Chattering ]
[Chattering Continues]
The first thing that I'm gonna do when I get back... is to get some decent food.
I can dig it, man. Let me tell you,
I've eaten worse food than this, but then I've tasted better, you know what I'm sayin'?
The other one over there.
Well, you pound down the stuff like there's no tomorrow.
I'd rather be eatin' something else, but, uh, right now I'm thinkin' food.
<i>[Kane] Well, you should know.

No, man, I don't wanna talk about what it's made of.
I'm eatin' this just to-

<i>You see anything?

<i>[ Loud Clank] [ Dallas

<i>Anybody wanna say anything?</i>
This is just an ordinary prod, like a cattle prod.
It's got a portable battery.
It's insulated all the way here, all the way up to here.
Just make damn sure nobody puts their hand on the end of it.
<i>It shouldn't damage the little bastard,</i> unless its skin's thinner than ours.
But it will give him a little incentive.
Now we just have to find it.
I've taken care of that. I've designed this tracking device.
You just set it to search for a moving object, like so.
<i>Hasn't got much of a range, but when you get within a certain distance,</i>
<i>it'll start to give off a signal.</i>
What's it key on?
Micro changes in air density.
Give me a demo.
[Whirring ] See? Again.
Got ya.
Two teams.
Ash, Lambert and I.
Ripley, you take
Parker and Brett.
Now, anyone see this thing, you catch it in the net... that Parker's holding on his lap.
Parker, I don't want any heroics out of you, all right?
<i>Catch it, put it in the airlock, get rid of it.</i>
<i>Now, channels are open on all decks.</i>
I want you to communicate, keepintouch at all times, all right?
Let's go.
I thought you fixed 12 module.
[Brett]
We did.
I don't understand it.
[ Parker] The circuits must have burned out.
What do we got here? Damn it! Hold your light over here, would you?
Yeah, that's it.
I don't know if this is gonna work.
If I could just put this- put this in there.
Right.
Oh, damn it.
<i>Check the insulation.</i>
Oh, Shit!
<i>[ Tracking Device Whirring]</i>
Steady. According to this, it's within five meters.
<i>[ Indistinct Whispering]
I Ripley] Open the door.</i>
<i>[ Ripley] Micro changes in air density, my ass.</i>
[Tracking Device Beeping ]
It's within five meters.
<i>[ Parker]
Be careful.</i>
[ Beeping Continues]
<i>[ Ripley] Christ. [ Parker] Don't do that.
Don't creep up on me with that thing.</i>
<i>[ Ripley]
You guys, stick together.</i>
<i>[ Tracker Twittering]</i>
Don't fail me now.
[ Parker] What?
What is it? Parker, Brett, it's in this locker!
Where?
[ Brett]
Here, take this.
Get over there and get the net.
Get it? I got it. I got it.
I got it.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
All right, Parker.
When I say.
All right. Now.
Easy.
[Hissing]
[All Chattering ]
Wait! Don't let him go!
What the hell are you doing, man?
It's the cat.
[Laughing]
Hey, look, now.
We had to bag it, man.
Now we might pick it up on the tracker again.
I'll I'll I'll
Go and get it, man.
All right. You get him.
We'll go on.
[ Sighs ]

I'm not gonna hurt you.
<i>Come on.</i>
[ Snarling ]
[Screaming ]
Whatever it was, it was- it was big and-
You're sure it took him into the air shaft?
Disappeared into one of the cooling ducts.
No question, it's- it's using the air ducts to move around.
Could he want
Brett alive?
What?
Could Brett be alive?
No. I mean,
I don't think so.
Well, this air shaft may work to our advantage.
Here it leads up to and comes out in the main air lock.
All right. There's only one big opening along the way.
We can cover that up, and then we... drive it into the air lock and zap it into outer space.
This son of a bitch is huge!
I <i>mean, it' is like a man- ll' is b/jg!</i>
<i>Kane's son.</i>
<i>Come on, Ash. Science department should be able to help us.</i>
What can we do to drive it?
Yes, well, it's adapted remarkably well to our atmosphere, considering its nutritional requirements.
The only thing we don't know about is temperature.
Okay. What about temperature?
What happens if we change it?
Let's try it.
I mean, most animals retreat from fire. Yes?
Fire, yeah.
Parker, can you rig...
<i>three or four incinerator units?</i>
Give me about 2O minutes.
<i>I'll</i> do it.
Who gets to go into the vent?
I do.
No.
You and Ash... take the main air lock.
Parker, Lambert, you cover up that maintenance opening, please.
<i>[ Lambert ]
Right.</i>
<i>[ Beepirly]</i>
[ Dallas] I'm at the first junction.
Dallas, I'm right here.
<i>Parker?</i>
Yeah?
<i>Lambert'?</i>
We're in position. I'm just trying to get a reading here.
The air lock is open.
<i>Okay,</i> R/jo/ey
Ready.
All right. I've got a reading on you now.
[Tracker Beeping ]
<i>Uh, open the hatch to the third junction.</i>
<i>[ Beepirly]</i>
<i>[</i> Beep/ng Continues] [
Dallas ] Okay, I'm through.
Ripley?
Yes.
Close all the hatches behind me.
I'm moving on.
<i>[ Lambert ] Dallas, hold it a minute.
I think I got it.</i>
<i>Yes, I've got it.
[Dal/as ] Where?</i>
[ Lambert] it's somewhere around the third junction.
Okay, moving on.
<i>It is right around there. Now, Dallas, you're gonna have to be careful.</i>
All right.
I've reached... the third junction, and I'm going down.
<i>[ Sensors Beeping]</i>
[ Beeping ]
The hell's the matter with that box?
Dallas, you're gonna have to hold your position for a minute. I-
<i>I've lost the signal.</i>
<i>What? You sure?</i>
<i>Look around. Are you sure ifs no! there .7 I13 go! to be around there somewhere.</i>
[ Dallas] Checked it out, Lambert.
You may be getting interference.
[ Lambert] Dallas, are you sure there's no sign of it?
<i>Imean, it is there.
It's gotta be around there.</i>
Dallas?
God, what is happening?
All right.
Uh, am I- am I clear, Lambert? I want to get the hell out of here.
[ Beeping ]
[ Lambert] Oh, God. it's moving right towards you.
Um-
Move! Get out of there!
Behind you! Move!
<i>Dallas! Move, Dallas!
Move, Dallas!</i>
<i>Get out! [ Sobbing ] Move!</i>
<i>The other way!</i>
[ Screeching ]
[Shrill Feedback]
Dallas?
Oh, no.
Take it easy.
[ Parker]
Dallas?
We found this laying there.
No blood.
No Dallas.
Nothing.
<i>How come I don 'z' hear nobody saying nothing ? I'm thinking.</i>
Unless somebody has got a better idea, we'll proceed with Dallas's plan.
What? And end up like the others?
Ohh. No, you're out of your mind.
Got a better idea?
Yes. I say that we abandon this ship.
We get the shuttle and just get the hell out of here.
We take our chances and just hope that...
<i>somebody picks us up.
Lambert.</i>
<i>The</i> shuttle <i>won't</i> take <i>four. Then wh y don'! we draw straws and-</i>
I'm not drawin' any straws. I'm for killing that goddamn thing right now.
<i>[ Ripley ]
Okay.</i>
Well, let's talk about killing it.
[ Parker Grumbling ]
We know it's using the air shafts-
Will you listen to me, Parker?
Shut up!
Let's hear it.
Let's hear it.
It's using the air shafts.
We don't know that.
That's the only way.
We'll move in pairs.
We'll go step by step...
<i>and cutoff e very bulkhead and every vent...</i> until we have it cornered, and then we'll blow it the fuck out into space.
Is that acceptable to you?
If it means killing it, it's acceptable to me.
Obviously it means killing it.
But we have to stick together.
<i>How are our weapons ?
The weapons</i> are fine.
This one needs refueling.
I/I//// you gel' it, please?
Ash, go with him. No, no.
I can manage, Ash.
Don't follow me.
Ash?
Any suggestions from you or Mother?
No, we're still coï¬afing.
[Laughs]
You're what?
You're still collating?
I find that hard to believe.
What would you like me to do?
Just what you've been doing, Ash.
Nothing. I've got access to Mother now, and I'll get my own answers, thank you.
All right.

<i>[ Parker] How come the company senz' us a goddamn robot'?</i>
[Ripley ] All I can think of is they must've wanted the alien for their weapons division.
He's been protecting it right along.
Parker, will you plug it in?
<i>[Parker]! don</i> 7 <i>know Why-</i> Because he <i>may know how to</i> kill <i>it.</i>
<i>[ Ripley J
Ash, can you hear me?</i>
Ash?
[ Distorted Voice]
Yes, I can hear you.
What was your special order?
You read it. I thought it was clear.
What was it?
Bring back life-form.
Priority one. All other priorities rescinded.
The damn company! What about our lives, you son of a bitch?
I repeat: All other priorities are rescinded.
<i>[ Ripley ]
How do we kill it, Ash?</i>
<i>There is go! to be a way of killing it'.
How- How do we do it'?</i>
You can't.
That's bullshit!
You still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you?
A perfect organism.
Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.
You admire it.
I admire its purity.
A survivor... unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality.
<i>[ Parker] Look, I- I've heard enough of this,</i> and I'm asking you to pull the plug.
<i>[Ash ] Last Word.</i> What?
I can't lie to you aboutyourchances,buL" you have my sympathies.
We're gonna blow up the ship.
We'll take our chances in the shuttle.
Blow up the ship.
Good.
Come on.
When we throw the switches, how long before the ship blows? Ten minutes.
No bullshit. If we ain't outta here in ten minutes, we won't need no rocket to fly through space.
We're gonna need coolant for the air support system.
You two go down, get all the coolant you can carry.
<i>I'll</i> get the shuttle ready.
<i>I'll</i> give you about- about seven minutes.
Come back up here.
I'll shut the switches off, and we'll blow this fucker off into space.
Okay. All right.
Come on.
Ready? Take care of yourself.
Seven minutes.
