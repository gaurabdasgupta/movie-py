Two days after the law is passed that allJews have to wear the star, theJewish tailors are turning them out by the gross... in a variety of fabrics at three zloty each.

I have an excellent

No, no, we don't have that.

Yes.
It's human nature.

Are you Itzhak Stern or not ?
I am.
Where can we talk ?
There's a company you did the books for on Lipowa Street.
Made what ?
Pots and pans ?
By law, I have to tell you, sir, I'm a Jew.
Well, I'm a German.
So there we are.
A good company, you think ?
Modestly successful.
I know nothing about enamelware.
Do you ?
I was just the accountant.
Simple engineering though, wouldn't you think ?
Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you ?
Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great.
You can make a fortune, don't you think ?
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Like what ?
[ Sighs ]
I'm sure you'll do just fine once you get the contracts.
In fact, the worse things get, the better you'll do.
Oh, well, I can get the signatures I need.
That's the easy part.
Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
You don't have any money ?
Not that kind of money.
You know anybody ?
[ Closes Case ]
Jews, yeah.
Investors. You must have contacts... in theJewish business community working here.
What community ?
Jews can no longer own businesses.
That's why this one's in receivership.
But they
I'd own it.
I'd pay them back in product-- pots and pans.
Pots and pans.
Something they can use.
Something they can feel in their hands.
They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want.
Everybody's happy.
If you want, you could run the company for me.
Let me understand.
They'd put up all the money,
I'd do all the work.
What, if you don't mind my asking, would you do ?
I'd make sure it's known the company's in business.
I'd see that it had a certain panache.
That's what I'm good at, not the work. Not the work.
The presentation.
I'm sure I don't know anybody who'll be interested in this.

For each thousand you invest,
I will repay you with...
Two hundred.
200 kilos of enamelware a month, to begin in July and to continue for one year.
After which time, we're even.
That's it. It's very simple.
Not good enough.
It's not good enough.
Not good enough ?
Look where you're living.
Look where you've been put.
''Not good enough.''

Money's still money.
No, it is not.
That's why we're here.
Trade goods-- that's the only currency... that'll be worth anything in the ghetto.
Things have changed, my friend.
Did I call this meeting ?
You told Mr. Stern you wanted to speak to me.
I'm here.
I've made you a fair offer.
Fair would be a percentage in the company.

The standard SS rate for
Jewish skilled labor is seven marks a day, five for unskilled and women.
This is what you pay the Reich Economic Office.
TheJews themselves receive nothing.
Poles you pay wages.
Generally, they get a little more.
Are you listening ?
What was that about the SS ?
The rate ? The what ?
TheJewish worker's salary-- you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker.
He gets nothing.
But it's less.
It's less than what
I would pay a Pole.
It's less.
That's the point
I'm trying to make.
Poles cost more.
[ Sniffs ]
Why should I hire Poles ?
An enamelware factory over at, uh, Lipowa Street.
It, uh, it, um--
It's owned by a German.
But it's outside the ghetto, so you can barter for extra goods-- for eggs, I don't know what you need-- with the Polish workers.
You can't get it here.

I am healthy.

No, no, no, that's not true.

I've got 3 50.

To make pots and pans ?
To make money.
For me.

Does anyone ask about me ?
Back home ?
Everybody.
All the time.
Hmm.
They won't soon forget the name Schindler here,
I can tell you that.
''Oskar Schindler,'' they'll say.
''Everybody remembers him.
''He did something extraordinary.
''He did something no one else did.
''He came here with nothing--
''a suitcase--
''and built a bankrupt company into a major manufactory.
''And left with a steamer trunk--
''Two steamer trunks full of money, all the riches of the world.''
Hmm.
It's comforting to see that nothing's changed.
You're wrong, Emilie.
[ Kissing Sound ]
There's no way I could have known this before, but there was always something missing.
In every business I tried,
I can see now, it wasn't me that failed.
Something was missing.
Even if I'd known what it was, there's nothing I could have done about it... because you can't create this thing.
And it makes all the difference in the world between success and failure.
Luck ?
War.
Should I stay ?
It's a beautiful city.
I asked you if I should stay.
It's up to you.
Promise me, Oskar, no doorman or maitre d' will ever presume...
I'm anyone other than Mrs. Schindler, and I'll stay.

There is a machinist outside... who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.

He's very grateful.
It'll just take a minute.
Mr. Lowenstein ?
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
You're welcome.
I'm sure you're doing a great job.
The SS beat me up.
They would have killed me, but I am essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
That's great.
I work hard for you.
I'm sure you do.
I'll continue to work hard for you.
That's great.

It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar.
You know it and I know it.

It's got a, um, ritual significance.

I woke up from a dream this morning.
I was broke and sharing a room with 1 2 people I didn't know, only to discover
I was broke and sharing a room with 1 2 people I didn't know.
[ Chuckling ]
You laugh about it ?
I have to laugh.
You are living behind walls.
The walls I can deal with.
It's the restrictions to my life I'm tired of.
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.
I like it here.
There's a kind of,
I don't know, ancestral squalor to it all.
You are a slave to these people.
No one envies us anymore.
I'm smart.
Oh, yes, you're smart.
You're a real genius.
You had your chance.
Today, today I actually found time to organize a thought.
I can't remember the last time I did that.
When's the last time we did this ?
When's the last time we stood around and talked ?
No one ordered me onto a truck today.
No one took my business away from me.
You don't really have a business to take.
There's nowhere down from here.
This is it.
This is the bottom.
The ghetto is... liberty.
This street divides the ghetto just about in half.
Right side, Ghetto A: civil employees, industrial workers and so on.
Left side, Ghetto B: surplus labor, the elderly and infirm mostly.
Which is where you'll want to start, huh ?
Do you have any questions, sir?
Ja, why is the top down ?
I'm fucking freezing.
[ Wilhelm Kunde ]
We expect a labor force of 25,000 to 30,000.
Segregated, of course.
The men in the barracks near the quarry.
The women on the other side of the wire.
[ Goeth ]
My place is where ?
There, sir.
There ?
You call that a villa ?
Yes, the villa.
Their synagogue, can you see it ?
That's not a villa.
We're planning to turn it into the camp stables.
It's a house.
[ Goeth ]
What's that over there ?
[ Kunde ]
Kindergarten.
Fifty-one.
And we have a dentist, shoemaker, practical physicians.
[ Guard ]
There they are, sir.
[ Goeth Sniffs ]
Hmm.
One of you is, uh, a very lucky girl.
There is an opening for a job, away from all this... backbreaking work, at my new villa.
[ Sniffs ]
Uh, which of you has... domestic experience ?
Ja, on second thought,
I don't really want someone else's maid.
All those annoying habits
I have to undo.
[ Chuckles ]
I don't want to give you my cold.
Uh, what's your name ?
Helen Hirsch.
What ?
[ Coughing ]

What ?
I can't hear.
Helen Hirsch.
Ja.
[ Woman ]
Take it all down.!
[ Officer Blows Whistle ]
To work.!
[ Woman Arguing ]
Take it down.!
It is not safe.!
She says the foundation was poured wrong.
She's got to take it down.
I told her it's the barracks, not the fucking Hotel Europa.
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch !
Herr Kommandant.
The entire foundation... has to be torn down and repoured.
If not, there will be at least a subsidence... at the southern end of the barracks.
Subsidence, and then collapse.
And you are an engineer ?
Yes.
My name is Diana Reiter.
I'm a graduate... of Civil Engineering from the University of Milan.
Ah, an educated Jew, like Karl Marx himself.
Unterscharfuehrer.!
Jawohl?
Shoot her.
What ?
[ Gasps ]
Herr Kommandant,
I'm only trying to do my job.
Ja, I'm doing mine.
But, sir, she's foreman of construction.
We are not going to have arguments with these people.
Okay.
No. Shoot her here, on my authority.
It will take more than that.
[ Goeth ]
I'm sure you're right.
Take it down, repour it, rebuild it. Like she said.
We have more to see, but we have only one more hour of light.
## [ Humming ]

Chaja, bread.
[ Goeth Continues ]
They came.
Not that fat. No, less.
They trundled their belongings into the city.
Yes, a bit less.
They settled.
They took hold.
They prospered... in business, science, education, the arts.
They came here with nothing.
####[ Praying Continues ]
Nothing.
And they flourished.
For six centuries there has been a Jewish Krakow.
Think about that.
By this evening, those six centuries are a rumor.
They never happened.

The SS will manage... certain industries itself inside Plaszow-- a metalworks, brush factory, another for reprocessing
Jewish clothing... from the ghettos for use by bombed-out families back home.
But it's private industry like yours that stands to benefit most... by moving inside the wire of
Commandant Amon Goeth's camp--
No, no, no. Sit, sit.
Julian, how are you ?
How are you ?
Good to see you, my friend.
Oskar Schindler.
LeoJohn.
[ Whispers, Chuckles ]
Franz, good to see you.
Hello, Oskar.
Glad you could join us.
My pleasure. Julius.
How are you ?
You lost weight.
Only in the shoulders.
Please, everybody, sit down.
How are you doing ?
Oskar Schindler.
We started without you.
Fine.
I miss anything good ?
I was explaining to Herr Bosch and Herr Madritsch... some of the benefits of moving their factories into Plaszow.
I meant the food.
[ Chuckles ]
Since your labor is housed on-site, it's available to you at all times.
You can work them all night if you want.
Your factory policies, whatever they've been in the past, they'll continue to be.
They'll be respected.
I have to know, where do you get a suit like that ?
What is that ? Is that silk ?
Of course.
Ja. It's-- It has a nice sheen about it.
Thank you.
Very nice.
I'd say I'd get you one, but the man who made it is probably dead.
I don't know.
[ Schindler's Voice ]
I go to work the other day.
Nobody's there.
Nobody tells me about this.
I have to fid out.
I have to go in.
Everybody's gone.
No.
[ Sighs ]
No.
They're not gone.
They're here.
They're mine !
Every day that goes by,
I'm losing money.
Every worker that is shot costs me money. I have to find somebody else.
We are going to be making so much money that none of this is going to matter.
It's bad business.
[ Sniffs ]
Thank you.
Leave the bottle.
Take that.
Lena... thank you.
Scherner told me something else about you.
Yeah ?
What's that ?
That you know the meaning of the word ''gratitude.''
That it's not some vague thing with you... like it is with others.
You want to stay where you are.
You've got things going on the side.
Things are good.
You don't want anybody telling you what to do.
I can understand all that, you know. I-- I know you.
What you want... is your own sub-camp.
Do you have any idea what is involved ?
The paperwork alone ?
You've got to build the thing.
Getting those fucking permits is enough to drive you crazy.
Then the engineers show up, they stand around, they argue about drainage, foundations, codes, exact specifications, fences four kilometers long,
1 ,200 kilograms of barbed wire,
[ Chuckling ]
6,000 kilograms of electrified fences, ceramic insulators, three cubic meters of air space per prisoner.
I'm telling you, you want to shoot somebody.
I've been through it. I know.
Well, you know.

I'd be grateful.

[ Machines Rumbling ]

It's an honor to work for such a great company.
It's great to have you.
I promise to learn everything about enamelware production.
That's great.
Hello ?
Miss Elsa Krause is here.
I only need five minutes.
She wants to speak to the Herr Direktor.
[ Typewriter Keys Clicking ]
Yes.
He won't see you.
Please, sit down.
Pernod ?
Cognac ?
Uh, no.
So, what can I do for you ?
[ Nervous Chuckle ]
They say that no one dies here.
They say your factory is a haven.
They say you are good.
Who says that ?
Everyone.
My name is Regina Perlman, not Elsa Krause.
I've been living in Krakow on false papers since the ghetto massacre.
My parents are in Plaszow.
Their names are
Chana and Jakob Perlman.
They are older people.
They are killing older people now in Plaszow.
They bury them up in the forest. Look...
[ Sighs ]
I don't have any money.
I, I borrowed these clothes.
I'm begging you.
Please, please bring them here.
I don't do that.
You've been misled.
I ask one thing: whether or not a worker has certain skills.
My father is an importer, not a metalworker.
[ Continues Arguing ]
Such activities are illegal.
You will not entrap me !
Cry, and I will have you arrested.
I swear to God !
[ Mutters, Sobbing ]
People die.
It's a fact of life.
He wants to kill everybody ?
Great ! What am I supposed to do about it ?
Bring everybody over ?
Is that what you think ?
Send them over to Schindler.
Send them all !
His place is a haven, didn't you know ?
It's not a factory.
It's not an enterprise of any kind.
It's a haven for rabbis and orphans... and people with no skills whatsoever !
[ Sighs ]
You think I don't know what you're doing ?
You're so quiet all the time.
I know, I know !
Are you losing money ?
That's not the point !
What other point is--
It's dangerous !
It's dangerous to me !
You have to understand.
Goeth is under enormous pressure.
You have to think of it in his situation.
He's got this whole place to run.
He's responsible for everything here, all these people.
He's got a lot of things to worry about.
And he's got the war which brings out the worst in people.
Never the good, always the bad.
Always the bad.
But in normal circumstances he wouldn't be like this.
He'd be all right.
There'd just be the good aspects of him which--
[ Chuckles ]
He's a wonderful crook.
A man who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money--
Killing.
He can't enjoy it.
Bejski told me the other day, somebody escaped... from a work detail outside the wire.
[ Gunshots ]
Goeth lined up everybody from the missing man's barracks.
He shot the man to the left of Bejski, the man to the right ofhim.
He walked down the line shooting every other man with the pistol.
Twenty-five.
What do you want me to do about it ?
Nothing, nothing.
We're just talking.

I'm sure this will be better than those rags, Lisiek.
Herr Direktor,
I was just helping Lisiek to find something... to clean the stains from the Herr Kommandant's bathtub.
Go, please.
Pardon me,
Herr Direktor.
[ Chuckles ]
You don't have to report to me, Helen.
You know who I am ?
Hmm ?
[ Whispering ]
I'm Schindler.
Of course.
I-I have heard and... you have been here before.
Here, why don't you keep this someplace ?
Go on, take it.
I get extra food here.
Well, if you don't want to eat it, trade it.
Or give it to Lisiek.
Why not build yourself up ?
My first day here, he beat me... because I threw out the bones from dinner.
He came down to the basement at midnight, and he-- he asked me where they were.
For his dogs, you understand.
I said to him, I--
I don't know how I say this.
I never could say it now--
I said to him,
''Why are you beating me ?''
He said, ''The reason
I beat you now... is because you ask why I beat you.''
I know your sufferings, Helen.
It doesn't matter.
I have accepted them.
Accepted them ?
One day he will shoot me.
No, no, no, no, he won't shoot you.
I know.
I see things.
We were on the roof on Monday, young Lisiek and I, and we saw the Herr Kommandant come out of the front door... and down the steps by the patio right there below us and-- and there on the steps he drew his gun and he... shot a woman who was passing by.
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.
Just-- Just a woman on her way somewhere, you know.
She was no fatter or thinner... or slower or faster than anyone else, and I couldn't guess what had she done.
The more you see of the Herr Kommandant, the more you see there is no set rules that you can live by.
You can't say to yourself,
''If I follow these rules,
I will be safe.''
He won't shoot you because he enjoys you too much.
He enjoys you so much he won't even let you wear the star.
He doesn't want anyone else to know... it's a Jew he's enjoying.
He shot the woman from the steps... because she meant nothing to him.
She was one of a series, neither offending or pleasing him.
But you, Helen.
It's all right.
It's not that kind of a kiss.
[ Sobbing ]
Thank you.

[ Sniffs ]
I watch you.
[ Sighs ]
You're never drunk.
[ Sniffs ]
Oh, that's-- that's real control.
Control is power.
That's power.
[ Schindler ]
Is that why they fear us ?
We have the fucking power to kill, that's why they fear us.
They fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily.
A man commits a crime, he should know better.
We have him killed, and feel good about it.
Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better.
That's not power, though.
That's justice.
It's different than power.
Power is when we have every justification to kill... and we don't.
You think that's power ?
That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something, he's brought in before the emperor, he throws himself down on the ground, he begs for mercy.
He knows he's going to die.
And the emperor... pardons him.
This worthless man.
He lets him go.
I think you are drunk.
That's power, Amon.
That... is power.
Amon the Good.
I pardon you.

I mean it.
If you need a reference after the war,
I'd be-- I'd be happy to give you one.
It must get lonely down here... when you're listening to everyone upstairs having such a good time.

The trains arrived and the people were driven out with clubs.
They were lined up in front of two big warehouses.
One was marked ''Cloak Room,'' and the other ''Valuables.''
And there they were made to undress.
AJewish boy handed them pieces of string to tie their shoes together.
They shaved their hair.
They told them it was needed to make something special for U-boat crews.
And then they were herded down a big corridor... to bunkers with
Stars of David on the doors, and signs that said
''Bath and Inhalation Room.''
SS gave them soap.
They told them to breathe all the time because it's good for disinfecting.
And then they gassed them.
Mila, why soaps ?
So that they would agree to go in, I think.
Come on, Mila, stop it.
Your bedtime stories are scaring everyone.
I just don't believe it.
Ja. You know it's ridiculous.
I don't believe it either.
I cannot believe it.
I didn't say I believed it.
I said I heard it.
From who ?
From somebody who heard it from someone who was there.
You know, if they were there, they would have been gassed.
Yes.
It doesn't make any sense.
We're their work force.
What sense does it make to kill your own work force ?
To go to all this trouble of assembling a work force only to--
No, it can't be true.
We are very, very important for them.
Ja, we do now.

But, you didn't see this girl.

They cast a spell on you, you know, theJews.

Nothing bad is going to happen to you there. You'll receive special treatment.
The directives coming in from Berlin mention ''Special Treatment'' more and more often.
I'd like to think that's not what you mean.

Do we have to invent a whole new language ?

She's not going to Auschwitz.
I'd never do that to her.

I want her to come to work for me there.
I want to grow old with her.
Are you mad ?
Amon, you can't take her to Vienna with you.
No, of course I can't.
That's what I'd like to do.
What I can do, if I'm any sort of a man, is the next most merciful thing.
I should take her into the woods and shoot her painlessly in the back of the head.

How old are you, Mother?
Sixty-eight.
Cough for me, Mother.
They say to fall against the fence is a kindness.
Don't kill yourself against the fence, Clara.
If you do, you'll never know what happened to you.
How old are you,
Mother ?
Sixty-six, sir.
Sir ?
Good morning.
A mistake has been made.
We are not supposed to be here.
We work for Oskar Schindler.
We are SchindlerJews.
Who is Oskar Schindler ?
He had a factory in Krakow.
Enamelware.
A potmaker.
How old are you, Mother ?
You are not the only industrialist who needs labor,
Herr Schindler.
I remember earlier this year,
I.G. Farben ordered... a trainload of Hungarians for his chemical factory.
The train came in through the archway, and the officer in charge of the selection went immediately to work... and sent 2,000 of them... straightaway to Special Treatment.
It is not my task to interfere with the processes that take place down here.
Why do you think I can help you if I can't help I.G. Farben ?
Allow me to express the reason.
[ Train Whistle Blowing ]
I'm not making any judgment about you.
It's just that I know that in the coming months... we're all going to need portable wealth.
I could have you arrested.
I'm protected by powerful friends.
You should know that.
I do not say
I am accepting them.
All I say is,
I'm not comfortable with them on the table.
I have a shipment coming in tomorrow.
I'll cut you
300 units from it.
New ones.
These are fresh.
The train comes, we turn it around.
Mmm, yes, yes.
It's yours.
I understand.
I want these.
You shouldn't get stuck on names.

Their fingers polish the insides of shell metal casings.
How else am I to polish the inside of a .45 millimeter shell casing ?
You tell me.

Under Department ''W'' provisions, it is unlawful to kill a worker without just cause.
Under the Businesses
Compensation Fund,
I am entitled to file damage claims for such deaths.
If you shoot without thinking, you go to prison,
I get paid.
That's how it works.
So, there will be no summary executions here.
There will be no interference of any kind with production.
In hopes of ensuring that, guards will no longer be allowed on the factory floor... without my authorization.
For your cooperation, you have my gratitude.
Come on, come.
[ Soldier ]
Mensch, seitJahren hab' ich so etwas nicht mehr gesehen.

I promise.
...sed libera nos a malo.
[ Schindler ]
Itzhak.
This is Itzhak Stern, my accountant. Itzhak--
You must be Mrs. Schindler.
It's a pleasure.
Emilie has volunteered to work in the clinic.
Very generous of you.
I know.
We need to talk when you have a moment.
This is my wife, Stern.
I don't keep any secrets from my spouse.
Oskar, please, attend to business. It's much more attractive.
Madam.
Hello.
What is it ?
We received an angry complaint from the Armaments Board.
The artillery shells, tank shells, rocket casings--
Apparently all of them have failed quality control tests.
That's to be expected.
Start-up problems.
This isn't pots and pans.
This is a precise business.
I'll write them a letter.
They're withholding payment.
Sure, so would I, so would you.
I wouldn't worry. We'll get it right one of these days.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.
They could shut us down, send us back to Auschwitz.
I'll call around, find out where we can buy shells.
Pass them off as ours.
I don't see the difference whether they're made here--
You don't see a difference ?
I see a difference.
You lose a lot of money.
Fewer shells will be made.
Stern, if this factory ever produces... a shell that can actually be fired,
I'll be very unhappy.
[ Woman ]
Hello, madam.
How do you do ?
[ Machine Whirring ]
[ Machine Grinding ]
How are you doing,
Rabbi ? Rabbi !
Good, Herr Direktor.
Sun's going down.
Yes, it is.
What day is this ?
Friday ?
It is Friday, isn't it ?
Is it ?
What's the matter with you ?
You should be preparing for the Sabbath.
Shouldn't you ?
I've got some wine.
In my office. Come.

Do you have any money, uh, hidden away someplace... that I don't know about ?
No.

[ Winston Churchill On Radio ]
Yesterday morning, at 24 1 a.m., at General Eisenhower's headquarters,
General Jodl... signed the ''Act of
Unconditional Surrender''... of all German land, sea and air forces in Europe... to the Allied
Expeditionary Force, and simultaneously to the Soviet High Command.
The German war is, therefore, at an end.
[ Footsteps Approaching ]
[ Knocking ]
But let us not forget for a moment--
I think it's time the guards came into the factory.
Japan, with all her treachery and greed--
[ Schindler ]
The unconditional surrender of
Germany has just been announced.
At midnight tonight, the war is over.
Tomorrow you'll begin the process... of looking for survivors of your families.
In most cases, you won't find them.
After six long years of murder, victims are being mourned throughout the world.
We've survived.
Many of you have come up to me and thanked me.
Thank yourselves.
Thank your fearless Stern... and others among you who worried about you... and faced death at every moment.
[ Sighing ]
I'm a member of the Nazi party.
I'm a munitions manufacturer.
I'm a profiteer of slave labor.
I am a criminal.
At midnight you'll be free, and I'll be hunted.
I shall remain with you until five minutes after midnight.
After which time, and I hope you'll forgive me,
I have to flee.
I know you have received orders from our Commandant, which he has received from his superiors, to dispose of the population of this camp.
Now would be the time to do it.
Here they are, they're all here.
This is your opportunity.
[ Murmuring ]
Or you could leave, and return to your families as men... instead of murderers.
[ Sighs ]
In memory of the countless victims among your people,
I ask us to observe three minutes of silence.

As soon as peace occurs,
I want... um, I want that cloth distributed to the workers.
Two and a half meters each.
Also, each person is to get a bottle of vodka.
They won't drink it.
They know its value.
Likewise for those
Egipshi cigarettes we organized.
[ Stern ]
It'll be done.
Everything you ask.
We've written a letter, trying to explain things... in case you are captured.
Every worker has signed it.
Thank you.
It is Hebrew, from the Talmud.
It says,
''Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.''
[ Ring Clattering ]
I could have got more out.
I could have got more.
I don't know.
If I just--
I could have got more.
Oskar, there are 1 ,1 00 people who are alive because of you.
Look at them.
If I'd made more money.
[ Laughs ]
I threw away so much money.
[ Sobbing ]
You have no idea.
If I had just--
There will be generations because of what you did.
I didn't do enough.
You did so much.
This car.
Goeth would've bought this car.
Why did I keep the car ?
Ten people right there.
Ten people.
Ten more people.
This pin.
Two people.
This is gold.
Two more people.
He would have given me two for it; at least one.
He would have given me one, one more.
One more person.
A person, Stern.
For this.
[ Sobbing ]
I could have gotten... one more person and I didn't.
And I-I didn't !

[ Russian Officer ]
Don't go east, that's for sure.
They hate you there.
I wouldn't go west either, if I were you.
We could use some food.
Isn't that a town over there ?
