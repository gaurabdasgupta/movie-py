Castro just sprung him.
This guy, man, was one of the top dogs for Fidel in the early days.
But Castro felt like he couldn't trust him anymore and threw him in jail.
But while he was on top, he tortured a few guys to death.
And one of the guy's brother is a rich guy in Miami now, and he wants the favor repaid.
That's where we come in.
He's ugly, man.

You wanna try it with her?
Why not?
You gonna watch me?
l'm lookin' at you. Go ahead.
You're not gonna do it.
Watch this.
Come on. l'm with you, man.
Okay. l'm gonna get her. l'm gonna get her.
Go ahead, Romeo!
Do your thing.
Just be quiet. Just hang back.
Romeo!
You're looking very pretty today. Yes, you. l've been watching you from over there.
You wanna see something funny? Hey, take a look over there. See that man?
Watch that guy. l gotta sit down here. l gotta watch my friend. He gonna stick his tongue out to that girl.
Look at that. Â¡Ay, coÃ±o!
You're sick!
You see what happened to him? Hey!
You know, if l wasn't a nice guy, l'd crack you.
She's too big for you.
Causing trouble like that. Come on.
Bitch!
What l try to tell you?
Lesbian!
What l try to tell you? This country, you gotta make the money first.
Then when you get the money, you get the power.
Then when you get the power, then you get the woman.
That's why you gotta make your own moves.
That's the one l rented.
No, no, no. They-- They--
That's her, man. There she is.
Oh, oh, oh.
'Bout time.
Frank got held up at the golf course.
He told me to pick you up.
Uh, he said he'd meet us at the track later.
He said to bet on lce Cream in the first, by the way. ln that thing?
You must be kidding.
What you talkin' about?
That's a Cadillac.
l wouldn't be caught dead in that thing.
Aw, come on.
Hey, you know, l mean, it's got a few years.
[Chuckles]
But it's a cream puff. lt looks like somebody's nightmare.
So, you like this better?
Yeah.
lt like one of them tigers from lndia, huh?
Tigers, no?
Crazy guy.
You know what he's been doin'?
Dragging me to the zoo to look at tigers.
He says he's gonna buy one now.
You do that, and you're not gonna have any friends left.
Not that you have any now--
You're gonna like that tiger, man.
You gonna drive around with a tiger in your passenger seat?
Maybe. Some lady tiger.
How much?
43,000, fully equipped.
That all?
Machine gun turrets are extra.
He's a funny guy.
Come here, Manny.
Bullet-proof this, okay?
And this here and here.
[Manny] Okay.
And the windows.
Okay.
And get me one of them phones, you know, with a scrambler.
And a scrambler.
And a radio with scanners, to pick out flying saucers, stuff like that.
Don't forget the fog lights.
Oh! ln case l get caught in the swamp.
That's a good idea.
[Horn Blaring]
Get out of the way, lady! l'm tryin' to drive here! l thought you were taking me to Frank.
We got an hour.
You hungry?
No, but l'm bored.
Well, that figures.
Hey, check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.
Yeah.
And, uh, you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?
Good doin' business with you.
Mr. Montana.
Oh, God! l wouldn't buy the car if you didn't like it.
Plannin' on driving the girls crazy, aren't you, Tony?
Oh, yeah.
You know who?
And what would Frank say? l like Frank, you know?
Only l like you better.
[Snorting]
You got some for me?
Sure.
[Tapping]
Okay.
[Snorting]
[Mutters]
Okay.
Don't get confused, Tony. l don't fuck around with the help.
Okay.
You wanna play that way with me, l play with you.
Shit.
Would you kiss me if l wear the hat?
No!
Playtime is over, okay?
[Laughing]
Okay.
[Knocking]
MamÃ¡.
Antonio.
Long time.
No postcards from jail?
Â¡CoÃ±o! Gina.
[Gasps]
Tony?
Oh, man, look at you. [Chuckles]
[Laughs]
Hey, you're beautiful.
l didn't--
MamÃ¡, look at those eyes, huh?
Look at that. She looks like me.
[Chuckles]
You know the last time l saw you, you was like that.
You looked like a little boy.
But now look at you.
Uh, l got something for you.
[Exhales Deeply]
For you.
This no big deal.
Oh, Tony!
[Crying]
[Laughs]
Oooh, Tony! l never thought l'd see you again, you know?
You think they're gonna keep a guy like me down?
Well, no.
[Laughs] No.
[Sighs]
You look so good.
Look. You open that up.
Open it.
For me?
l think so. lt's nothing much, you know. Nothing.
[Sighs]
See?
Do you see what's written on the back?
On the back?
[Sighs]
''Always.''
''Always.'' lt's beautiful, Tony!
So MamÃ¡ is still working in the factory, and l'm working part-time in a beauty parlor. l'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram GonzÃ¡lez?
His father owned that barbershop. lt's his place.
Plus l go to junior college.
Miami Dade.
And in two more years, l get my cosmetology license.
And then l'll be making enough money--
Surprise!
All that's over... starting today.
Why?
My kid sister don't have to work in no beauty parlor, and MamÃ¡, she don't have to sew in no factory.
Your son made it, MamÃ¡.
He's a success.
That's why l didn't come around before. l want you to see what a good boy l been.
Here's a thousand dollars.
For you, MamÃ¡.
[Clears Throat]
Who did you kill for this, Antonio?
MamÃ¡. l didn't kill nobody, MamÃ¡.
No?
No.
What are you doing now?
Banks, or is it still bodegas, you and the others?
No! Things are different now. l'm working with an anti-Castro group. l'm an organizer now, and l get a lot of political contributions.
Sure you do.
A gun sticking in somebody's face is how.
You know, all we hear about in the papers... is animals like you and the killings. lt's Cubans like you who are giving a bad name to our people.
People who come here, work hard and make a good name for themselves.
People who send their children to school--
MamÃ¡! What are you saying?
That's your son!
[Shouts] Son?
l wish l had one. He's a bum.
No. No.
He was a bum then, and he's a bum now.
Who do you think you are, hmm?
We haven't heard a word from you in five years.
Cinco aÃ±os.
You suddenly show up here, throw some money around... and think you can get my respect.
-You think you can buy me with jewelry?
-Come on, MamÃ¡.
You think you can come into my house with your hotshot clothes... and your jail manners and make fun of us?
MamÃ¡, you don't know what you're talking about.
That's not the way l am!
That is not the way l raised Gina to be!
You are not going to destroy her. l don't need your money.
Gracias. l work for my living. l don't want you in this house anymore! l don't want you around Gina.
So, come on. Get out!
Okay.
No. MamÃ¡--
And take this lousy money with you.
lt stinks.
Tony--
Why do you have to spoil it for everybody, huh? l'm sorry, Tony.
Okay, MamÃ¡.
Oh, no, no.
Tony, wait a minute!
Don't go, please!
Gina, stay here!
[Gina] No, no, no, MamÃ¡--
[MamÃ¡] He's no good. Gina!
Tony, wait, please!
Gina! l'm sorry. l don't know, MamÃ¡--
Ever since PapÃ¡ left she's--
Forget PapÃ¡.
We never had one. l know you did some bad things back then. ln the army, l know you got into some trouble.
The Communists, they're always trying to tell you what to do.
MamÃ¡ doesn't understand that.
l know. l just-- l don't know. l just want you to know, you know, l don't care. lt doesn't matter to me how long you've been away, five or ten years.
You're my blood, always. l know. l know.
Come on. Come on. l want you to take this.
l gotta go back in.
No, Tony. Please. Tony.
You need this. Come on.
What am l gonna tell her?
Take that. You don't tell her anything.
Don't tell her l give it to you, but give her some from time to time.
And listen, you go out yourself, you know?
Go ahead, go out, do some things.
Have some fun.
You gotta get some fun out of life.
You gonna beat yourself to death at 19?
Pussycat like you?
Come here.
Mmm.
l'll talk to you again, all right?
Okay.
Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.
l'll talk to her.
Okay. l'll talk to you.
[Train Whistle Blowing]
Okay.
Okay, let's go.
She's beautiful.
How come you--
Hey!
Stay away from her, man.
You hear?
She not for you.
Okay.
So this and my other factory, l can guarantee production... of 200 kilos refined every month of the year.
The problem is l have no steady market.
Basically, what l'm looking for is somebody in the States... who can share the risk with me, somebody who can guarantee to buy from me, say, 150 kilos a month.
Oh! That's a big commitment,
Mr. Sosa.
Something like that, uh-- lt's too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.
lt would've been nice if he could have come.
He would like to come, but with his trial coming up, it's hard for him to get out of the country.
So he sent you instead?
Yeah, something like that.
We'll talk at my house, shall we?
You got good stuff here.
Class 'A' shit.
So this LÃ³pez guarantees to buy from me
150 kilos every month of the year.
He picks it up here. l can sell it to him for as little as, uh... 7,000 a key.
You cannot do better than that.
Yeah, but then we gotta take the risk of moving it.
Also, we'll be cutting out the
Colombians. You know what that means?
That means we have to go to war with them.
We cut out the Colombians, we take risks on both sides.
Why don't we split the risk?
You guarantee your delivery, say, as far as Panama.
We take it from there.
Panama is risky. lt costs me more.
Panama l can sell for...
13.5 a key.
What, are you nuts?
13.5? We still gotta take that shit to Florida, man.
Do you know what that's like these days? You got the fucking navy.
You got frogmen. You got EC-2s with the satellite-tracking shit.
You got the fucking
Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass.
We're losing one out of every nine loads.
That's no duck walk anymore, man, let me tell you.
Forget about 13.5.
[Phone Ringing]
Well, what do you suggest that is reasonable?
[Ringing Continues]
Excuse me one moment.
Hey, Montana, what the fuck's the matter with you?
You negotiating for Frank LÃ³pez, huh?
Don't worry about it.
Take it easy.
l'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it. lf he wants to make a deal, it's up to him, not you.
We're gonna do this one deal. That's it.
Fuck you. How's that?
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
[Omar] You need to open your eyes and keep your mouth shut.
That's it. Let it go at that.
Don't worry about it.
Your head is in the wrong place.
You got to watch out for yourself.
Why don't you talk to him about it? You think he wants to give you the money?
Shut the fuck up.
l'm doing the talking here, not you.
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.
Better than your front, let me tell you.
That's easier to watch.
[Omar]
Close your mouth. l can't wait to see what Frank's gonna react to this one.
Just shut up. l'm doing the talking here.
Now where were we?
Panama.
You're looking for a partner, right?
Something like that.
Look, Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. l am down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it.
That's my limit. l got no right--
Nobody got no right to negotiate for Frank--
Let the man finish, okay?
Let him propose a proposition; then we can talk more.
You got no authority here. l started you in this fucking business, so shut the fuck up.
Frank is gonna love it.
Don't worry about it.
That's up to Frank, not you! l'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.
No, it is all right.
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.
Well, good. l don't think it's something l wanna do on an overseas phone.
But as soon as l get back to Miami, l will talk to Frank personally.
Good.
My associates here can escort you to my chopper.
My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz. l have a jet there, can have you in Miami in five hours.
You should be back here tomorrow in time for lunch.
Good. Good. Good.
Good. Good. Good.
Hasta maÃ±ana.
Good talking to you.
Why don't you leave your friend here?
While you are gone, maybe he can tell me how to run my business.
l think Frank would like to see him--
No, that's okay.
You tell Frank l keeping this guy on ice for him.
[Chuckling]
[Chuckling] l guess so.
[Sosa]
Let's finish our lunch. l have to hand it to you, Mr. Sosa.
You got everything a man could want. l like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.
Unfortunately, l do not feel the same about the rest of your organization.
[Helicopter Whirring Overhead]
What do you mean by that, Mr. Sosa? l'm talking about Omar SuÃ¡rez.
This garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch...
[Helicopter Whirring] from several years ago in New York.
He was an informer for the police.
[Omar Screaming]
[Sosa] He put Vito Duval and the Ramos brothers, Nello and Gino, away for life.
So how do l know you're not a chivato too, Tony?
Hey, Sosa.
Let's get this straight now. l never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it comin' to him.
You got that?
All l have in this life is my balls and my word, and l don't break 'em for no one, you understand?
That piece of shit up there, l never like him, l never trusted him.
For all l know, he had me set up and had my friend, Ãngel FernÃ¡ndez, killed.
But that's history. l'm here, he's not.
You wanna go on with me, say it.
You don't, then you make a move. l think you speak from the heart, Montana.
But l say to myself, this LÃ³pez, your boss, he had chivatos like that working for him.
His judgment stinks.
So l think to myself, how many other mistakes has this LÃ³pez guy made?
How can l trust his organization?
You tell me, Tony.
Frank is smart, you know?
You can't blame him for that animal. lt's a crazy business we're in, you know?
That could happen to anyone, even you.
Why don't l go back and talk to Frank... and work it out? l fix things between us.
You got my word on it. l think you and me, we can work this thing out, we do business together a long time.
Just remember-- l'll only tell you one time-- don't fuck me, Tony.
Don't you ever try to fuck me.
You what?
You made a deal for a fucking $18 million... without even checking with me?
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?
CoÃ±o, Frank. Take it easy.
Â¡CoÃ±o, my ass!
At 10.5 a key, it's puro.
You can't lose money.
No way.
We make 75 million on this deal, Frank.
Seventy-five million.
That is serious money.
What the fuck is Sosa going to do when l don't come up with the first five million?
What is he gonna do? ls he gonna send me a bill?
He's gonna send a fucking hit squad up here!
Relax! Take it easy. l'm in tight with Sosa.
You short a couple of mil, l go on the street for you. l make a couple of moves, a mil here, a mil there, you got it.
Okay?
Oh, you've been making moves on your own, huh? l got ears, you know? l hear things.
Yeah?
What do you hear about Echevierra and the DÃ­az brothers?
What about Gaspar GÃ³mez?
What is he gonna do when you start moving 2,000 keys--
Fuck Gaspar GÃ³mez and fuck the fucking DÃ­az brothers!
Fuck 'em all! l bury those cockroaches!
What they ever do for us?
Look, Frank, the time has come.
We gotta expand.
The whole operation.
Distribution.
New York, Chicago, L.A.
We gotta set our own mark and enforce it.
We gotta think big now.
Think big.
Like your friend Sosa.
Let me tell you something about that greaseball cocksucker.
He is a snake, that's what he is.
You turn your back on him, he'll stick it in.
You don't trust a guy like that.
You want me to believe...
Omar was a stoolie because Sosa said so?
You bought that line.
Maybe l made a mistake sending you down there.
Maybe you and Sosa know something l don't know.
Like what?
Like what?
[Chuckling]
You tell me like what?
You calling me a liar, Frank?
That what you calling me?
Let's just say l want things to stay the way they are for now.
You stall your deal with Sosa.
Stall him?
Okay, boss.
Come on. l am the boss.
Sure, you're the boss.
Hey, Tony.
Remember l told you when you started... the guys who last in this business... are the guys who fly straight-- low-key, quiet.
And the guys who want it all-- chicas, champagne, flash-- they don't last.
You finished?
Can l go now?
[Birds Calling]
Hi there.
Tony.
You just missed Frank.
Oh, yeah?
Too bad.
Only l didn't come to see Frank.
This is not the time or the place, Tony.
Next time, make an appointment first.
That's okay. l got something important l want to talk to you about.
Okay?
So why don't we have a couple of drinks, act normal... and just take it easy, huh?
Come on. l like Scotch.
Sure. Why not?
Okay. l won't bite you.
We're all normal here.
[lce Cubes Clinking] l heard you and Frank aren't working together anymore.
That's right. l think it's easier, don't you?
Makes things easier.
Well, uh--
Thank you.
Here's to the land of opportunity.
For you, maybe.
You like kids?
Kids?
Kids. You know, kid.
Little kids.
[Sighs] Sure. Why not?
As long as there's a nurse.
Good, 'cause l like kids too. l like 'em. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.
[Sighs]
Look, Frank's gonna be back any minute.
Come here.
Come on. Come on.
Sit here. l want to talk to you. Sit down. l'm not gonna bite you.
Okay, here's the story. l come from the gutter. l know that. l got no education, but that's okay. l know the street, and l'm making all the right connections.
With the right woman, there's no stopping me. l could go right to the top.
Anyway, what l got to tell you is this: l like you. l like you the first time l laid eyes on you. l say, ''She's a tiger.
[Chuckles]
She belong to me.''
Anyway... l want you to marry me. l want you to be the mother of my children.
Me? Marry you?
That's right.
[Sighs]
What about Frank, Tony?
What are you gonna do about Frank?
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.
Just think about it, okay? l want you to really think about it.
Okay? l go now.
Take care.
// [Technopop Playing]
All your enemies are gone.
// [Technopop Playing]
All your enemies are gone.
Mr. Montana.
How are you?
Hello, boss.
What the fuck she doin' here?
Come on, man. Come on, come on.
She's just dancing.
Come on.
Take it easy.
Right? l mean, it's just a disco.
Who that guy she with?
He's some guy who works for Lugo.
He's nobody.
He's harmless.
Works for Lugo?
Yeah. He's--
Forget him.
[Mutters]
Hello, Tony.
Well, you remember me.
Bernstein.
Mel Bernstein, right?
Chief detective, narcotics.
That's right, yeah. l think we should talk.
Talk? What are we going to talk about? l ain't killed nobody.
Not lately.
No, not lately. What about ancient history, like Emilio Rebenga?
Or a bunch of whacked-out lndians at the Sun Ray Motel?
Mel, who's ever giving you your information is taking you for a long ride.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Tony, baby, we gonna talk, or am l gonna bust your wise-ass spic balls here and now?
[Woman Singing]
/ Turn out the night /
/ l can be strong //
Keep your eye on her.
l'll do that.
Okay.
My office.
Good.
The word on the street is you're bringing in a lot of yeyo.
That means you're not a small-time punk anymore.
You're public property now.
Supreme Court says your privacy can be invaded.
Okay. How much?
How much?
Well, there's an answer to that too.
Here's how much.
Can you see it?
Big number.
Yeah!
That's on a monthly basis, same thing every month.
You know how this works?
No. You tell me.
We tell you who's moving against you, and we shake down who you want shaken down.
Let's say that you got a real problem making a collection.
Hmm? And then we step in for you.
Got eight killers with badges working for me. When they hit, it hurts.
Same thing works the other way.
You feed me a bust now and then-- some cowboy setting himself up in business.
Small-fry, you know?
[Sighs]
We like snacks.
How do l know you're the last cop l'm gonna have to grease?
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro? D.E.A.?
How do l know what rock they're gonna crawl out from under?
Well, it's not my business, Tony, you know? We don't cross no lines.
[Chuckles] Listen, you think l want this conversation... going any farther than this table?
My guys got families.
They're legitimate cops. l don't wanna see them embarrassed. lf they're embarrassed, they're gonna suffer. lf they suffer, they're gonna make you suffer.
Comprende?
You understand what l'm talking about? Huh?
[Crowd Chattering]
/ She's on fire, fire, fire /
Thank you for the drink.
Oh, by the way, l got a vacation coming up. l'm gonna take the wife to London, England.
We've never been there.
So, throw in a couple of round-trip tickets, first class, okay?
You oughta smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.
Every day above ground is a good day.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
Now that's the idea.
Okay, Mel.
You think about what l said?
About the kids? Hmm?
You know, you are really nuts.
You know that, Tony?
l'm nuts about you.
Hey, Tony, why don't you find your own girl?
My own girl?
Yeah.
That's what l'm doing.
Go do it somewhere else. Get lost.
Maybe l don't hear so good sometime.
You're not going to be hearing anything if you go on.
You gonna do something?
You're fucking right l'm going to do something! l'm giving you orders. Blow!
Orders?
You giving me orders?
Amigo, the only thing in this world... that gives orders is balls.
You got that?
[Tony]
Balls.
Let's go.
/ She's on fire //

Looking good, honey.
Keep up the bad work.
That cocksucker.
What happened?
He put that prick Bernstein on me.
Who? LÃ³pez did?
How do you know?
Who else knew about Rebenga? Omar?
He's fertilizer.
[Laughing]
He's letting me know he's got weight on me. l'll tell you what, man.

What? l saw him putting his hand all over your ass. My kid sister in the toilet.
lt's none of your business.
None of my business?
The fuck it ain't!
[Gina]
You can't tell me what to do! l'm telling you what to do!
Listen to me. Come here.
[Panting] Mm-hmm.
l catch you here again-- l catch you here again, l'm gonna wipe you all over the fucking place.
Oh, yeah? Go ahead!
Do it now. l wanna see it.

You want something? Huh?
No. Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Gina, have a seat.
No. No.
We'll get outta here.
Not there. l don't wanna go out there.
Come on.
Another great night here at the Babylon, right?
[Rim Shot]
Okay. All right!
[Audience Cheering]
Do another gram, you'll all be babbling on.
[Audience Laughing] ls that coke in your bra, or are you just glad to see me?
A little bit of hope, l'm sure, yes. l was a little depressed when l got up this morning.
l had a dry dream, but--
[Audience Laughing] l'm better now.
[Continues, lndistinct]
[Slide Whistle] l do Laurel & Hardy in Spanish too.
Â¿QuÃ© pasÃ³, amigo?
Mmm, mmm, mmm!
That's the height of culture, l can assure you.
But my favorite Cuban of all time has to be Ricky Ricardo.
Mr. Babaloo himself.
He had the same problem for ten years.
[lmitating Ricky Ricardo]
Lucy, don't come down to the club.
Fred and Ethel--
[Continues, lndistinct]
[M.C. Continues, lndistinct]
[Laughter Continues]
He's your brother. He loves you.
That's why he did it.
All right?
He cares about you.
To him, you're still his little sister--
Right!
That's the problem.
He still treats me like l'm a baby. l'm 20 years old now.
l'm not anybody's baby.
Oh, you're so grown up.
Come on, Gina.
Put yourself in his place, okay?
Right now, you happen to be the best thing in his life.
The only thing that's any good, that's pure.
So, of course he doesn't want you mixing with those people, growing up to be like him.
He has this father thing for you.
He feels like he has to protect you.
Protect me against what?
Against guys like that asshole that you were dancing with tonight.
Hey, l like Fernando.
He's a fun guy and he's nice.
And he knows how to treat a woman. All right?
He knows how to treat a woman? By taking you to the toilet to make out?
You've been a great audience. Calm down. l got a special treat for you.
Here's a guy l found strolling in the jungle. He's from Caracas, Venezuela.
He's unlike anything you'll ever see in your life.
Give a warm Babylon welcome to the one and only Octavio!

lt's not for me. Don't look at me.
[Miriam] How do you know?
'Cause l'm not here.
Oh, really?
Then where are you? [Laughing]
[Ringing Continues]
Shit, you're weird. [Laughing]

Hello?
[Tony] Hello, Miriam?
Hey, Tony!
Put Manny on, okay?
Okay. Just a second. lt's Tony. Mmm!
MamÃ¡? What are you doing, checking up on me?
Get your clothes on and meet me in front of LÃ³pez Motors in 45 minutes.
What are you talking about?
What happened?
Nothing we can't face.
All right. l'll-- l'll be there.
You're still on the phone. Let's go.
Take it easy, okay?
l'm leaving now. Fuck.
[Receiver Clicks]
Uh, Nick?
Yeah, Tony.
This is what l want you to do for me:
You call LÃ³pez.
Call him at his office at 3:00 sharp, okay?
Okay.
And you tell him-- you tell him,
''We fucked up, he got away.''
Okay. Yeah.
You got it?
What are you going to say?
We fucked up.
He got away.
What time?
3:00, sharp.
[Frank] Yeah? So when are we gonna make some money on this thing?
Six months to start don't mean shit, Larry.
Hey, l'm not a Rockefeller, you know? Not yet anyway.
[Laughing]
So you owe me a quarter.
Listen, go down to the ball game tonight? l couldn't make it. l got things-- l'll tell you about 'em.
You're kidding?
What was the score?
Three to two?
[Laughing]
Hey, Mel, guess what?
My Little League team, the Little Lopezers, they won the division tonight.
That's great. That's great.
[Laughing]
What'd you do, fix the umpire, Frank?
Jesus... Christ.
Tony, what happened to you?
They wanted to spoil my $800 suit.
Who the fuck did this, huh?
Hitters. l don't know.
Somebody must've brought 'em in. l've never seen 'em before.
Hello, Mel.
Got an answer to this too?
There always is, Tony.
l'll bet it was the DÃ­az brothers.
They got a beef going back to the Sun Ray thing.
Maybe you're right, you know?
Maybe you're right.
Anyway, l-l'm glad you made it, Tony.
We'll return the favor for you, in spades.
No, l take care of this myself.
What is the gun for, Tony?
What, this? lt's nothing. l, uh--
How do you say?
Paranoid.
[Phone Ringing]
[Ringing Continues]
You gonna answer, Frank?
[Ringing Continues] lt must be Elvira. She... got mad after we left the club.
You know?
[Ringing Continues] l tell her you're not here, okay?
No, it's all right.
l'll talk to her.
[Ringing]
[Ringing Continues]
Hello. lt's all right. l'm gonna be home in an hour. Don't worry.
Hey, Frank, you're a piece of shit.
What are you talking about?
You know what l'm talking about, you fucking cockroach.
What are you talking about?
Listen to me, huh?
You know what a chazzer is, Frank?
That's a pig that don't fly straight.
Neither do you, Frank.
Hey, Tony, why the fuck would l hurt you? l brought you in.
So we had a few differences, huh?
No big deal. l gave you your start. l was the one who believed in you. l stayed loyal to you. l made what l could on the side, but l never turned you, Frank!
Never!
But you--
A man who ain't got his word is a cockroach.
Mel, come on.
Do something, will you? lt's your tree, Frank.
You're sitting in it.
Okay.
All right, Tony. l was the one.
[Cocks Hammer]
Please, give me a second chance.
Huh, Tony?
Will you, will you do that? Please? l--
You give me a second chance, l give you ten million dollars.
Okay?
Ten million dollars. l got it in a vault over there in Spain, Tony.
We go over there; we get on a plane, and it's yours.
Okay? All of it.
Ten million dollars.
Okay, Tony? Huh?
Please, Tony?
[Sobbing]
Elvira? Elvira!
You want Elvira!
You can have her. l go away. l'm gonna disappear.
You'll never see me again.
Please, Tony, l don't want to die. l never did nothing to nobody.
No, no, you never did nothing to nobody.
You had somebody else do it for you.
Tony, l am begging you--
Get up! Get up now!
Jesus! No! God! [Sobbing]
[Sobbing Continues]
Look. Tony, no, don't kill me, please.
[Frank Moans]
l won't kill you.
Oh, Christ, thank you.
Get off my foot.
Thank you. Thank you.
Manolo, shoot that piece of shit!
No! No! No!
Oh!
[Sighs]
Every dog has his day, huh, Mel? l told him... it didn't make any sense, clipping you when we had you working for us.
He wouldn't listen.
He got hot tonight, about the broad, you know?
He fucked up.
You too, Mel.
You fucked up.
Don't go too far, Tony.
[Sighs] l'm not, Mel. You are.
[Groaning, Gasps]
Fuck.
You can't shoot a cop!
Whoever says you was one?
Wait a minute!
You let me go. l'll fix this up.
Sure, Mel.
Maybe you can hand yourself... one of them first-class tickets to the Resurrection.
Fuckin' punk!
Son of a bitch!
So long, Mel. Have a good trip.
Fuck you!
Okay, come on.
What about Ernie?
You want a job, Ernie?
Sure, Tony.
Okay, then you call me tomorrow.
Hey, man, you got a job!
[Chuckles]
Hey, Tony! Thanks.

[Tony] So you come to me with some kind of thing. Okay.
You propose it, l talk to you.
[Clears Throat]
But we got a problem, you know? l can't pay more. l'm bringing in twice as much as l ever did before.
We're doing ten million, fifteen million a month. Come on.
That's serious money, you know?
You bank boys gotta come down a bit.
No way.
That's crazy. We can't do that.
Then that's too bad.
What am l gonna do?
Tony, sweetheart, we're not a wholesale operation.
We're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me, the harder it is for me to rinse.
That's a problem. l didn't know.
The fact is l can't take any more of your money... unless l raise the rates on you.
You gonna raise the r--
l gotta do it.
The l.R.S. is coming--
Don't give me that shit!
Jerry, talk to me, man.
l'm talking.
l go low, you go high. l know the game.
This is business talk.
Don't talk to me like that.
Let me explain something.
The l.R.S. is coming down heavy on south Florida.
There was a Time magazine story that didn't help.
There's a recession. l got stockholders l gotta be responsible for.
l gotta do it, Tony.
Listen to this guy.
You're gonna learn from him. l gotta go 10 percent on the first
12 million in denominations of 20. l'll go eight percent on your ten-dollar bills and six points on your fives.
That's it.
We're going somewhere else, okay?
There's no place else to go. lt's not a conspiracy.
Fuck you, man! Fuck you!
l fly the cash myself to the Bahamas.
Once maybe. Then what?
Huh? Then what? You gonna trust some monkey in a Bahamian bank... with 20 million of your hard-earned dollars?
Come on, Tony.
Don't be a schmuck.
Who else can you trust? That's why you pay us what you do. You trust us.
Huh?
Did you hear that guy? You gotta listen to him. You'll learn something.
Stay with us. You're an old and well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.
And l gotta run.
l'm safe but poor.
How's married life treating you?
Better than you are.
[Laughing] Say hello to the princess for me, will you?
She's beautiful.
Okay.
l'll see you. Take care.
You too.
[Tony]
Come here.
That prick!
Fuckin' WASP whore.
Talkin' to me like l-- l some maricÃ³n come over on a boat. l tell you what.
We don't need that smilin' motherfucker.
We should talk to this Jewish guy,
Seidelbaum, okay?
He's got his own exchange.
He charges four percent at the most. And he's connected.
Fuck 'em.
Mob guys. Guineas.
[Snorting] l don't trust 'em.
Hey, Manny.
Did you sweep the house this month?
The cars?
Yeah. l told you about it.
The $5,000?
Look at that.
[Sniffs] What?
[Tony]
That cable truck there.
Since when does it take three days to rig a cable?
What? You been watching it for three days?
The fuckin' thing has been there for three days? What am l gonna do, not look at it?
What, you think it's cops, right?
l don't know.
Could be the DÃ­az brothers, come to get me.
Maybe. l'll check it out, okay?
You check it out. Then we're gonna blow that fuckin' truck back to Colombia!
Come on, come on.
Monina.
We're not the only dopers living on the block, okay? Remember that.
That fucking truck, that could be anybody and anything. lt could be a cable company--
You know something?
You got some fuckin' attitude.
For someone who's in charge of my security--
Here. Here are the keys to the front door. Go down there.
Give 'em the fuckin' keys!
l'm just tryin' to say something.
What?
You're spending a lot of money on this countersurveillance.
l don't give a fuck. lt's already twelve percent of our adjusted gross.
Twelve percent is not peanuts. l don't give a fuck! lt makes me sleep good at night. That's what counts.
Okay? You worry about it.
l am worried about it. l'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.
Our thinking, our fuckin' attitude, you know?
We're not fuckin' hungry anymore.
Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.
Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.
New construction.
New jobs.
Growth that's financed by Florida Security Trust.
We've been putting your money to work for 75 years building a more prosperous Miami.
Count on us being here tomorrow.
[Tony] Oh, yeah?
That's because for 75 years you been fuckin' everybody.
Somebody should do something about these-- these whores. l mean, chargin' me ten points on my money.
They're gettin' away with it.
Fuck, there's no laws anymore.
Forget it, man.
l mean, anything goes.
They been around a thousand years.
They got all the angles figured out.
You know what capitalism is?
Gettin' fucked.
[Elvira]
True capitalist if ever l met one.
[TV Shuts Off]
Uh-oh. Did you hear that?
How would you know, bubblehead?
You ever do nothin' besides get your hair fixed and powder your nose?
Look at it. You do too much of that shit, you know?
Nothing exceeds like excess.
You should know that, Tony.
l should know what?
What should l know?
Why do you have to talk to me like that all the time for?
Like l gotta know something.
Let me talk to you.
Listen to me.
This Seidelbaum. Five to 7:00.
What time is it?
Okay.
Okay?
l met with this guy--
The drug-related violence that's plagued south Florida...
He's good for a laugh, this guy. forces one to ask a question:
How, with a small law enforcement budget, can you put a dent... on an estimated
$100 billion-a-year business? lt seems at times all you can do is put your finger in the dike and pray.
Put your fingers in a dike?
The only place you can get your fingers in some dyke.
Not by outlawing the substances, but by legalizing and taxing them.
These voices say that will drive out the organized crime element. l am not one of those voices. l know that.
But you know why, Vic?
'Cause you got your head up your culo, that's why.
That fuckin' guy, he never tells the truth.
...splendor of our city at its best. lt's those guys, man! lt's the fuckin' bankers, the politicians-- they're the ones that wanna make coke illegal!
So they can make the fuckin' money, and they get the fuckin' votes!
They fightin' the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!
They fuck anything and anyone--
Can't you stop saying ''fuck'' all the time?
Can't you stop talking about money? lt's boring, Tony.
Where's this comin' from, man?
Boring? What's boring?
You're boring.
Oh.
Money, money, money, money, money.
That's all l ever hear in this house.
Manny, look at the pelican fly.
Come on, pelican!
Here it is.
Frank never talked about money.
Oh.
That's 'cause he was so smart, you know?
[Tony Muttering]
Cuidado. Se te cae.
You know what you're becoming, Tony?
You're an immigrant spic millionaire... who can't stop talking about how much money he's got--
Who you callin' a spic, you white piece of bread?
Get out of the way of the television!
Why don't you dig a hole in the garden and bury it? l work hard for this! l want you to know that. lt's too bad.
Somebody should've given it to you.
You would've been a nicer person.
Oh. You know what your problem is, pussycat?
What is my problem?
You got nothing to do with your life.
Why don't you get a job or something, you know?
Do something.
Be a nurse.
Work with blind kids, lepers.
Anything beats lying around all day waitin' for me to fuck you!
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.
Oh, no?
Frank was better, huh?
You're an asshole!
Where you going?
Come here!
Hey, Elvie! l was kidding! l was only kidding! l guess sometimes married life is not all it's cracked up to be, you know?
Where you goin'?
l got a date.
You got a date?
Yeah.
Come here.
What?
This Seidelbaum thing.
Yeah, it's all set up.
Yeah, well, you forget it.
Stay out of it. l take care of it.
''Stay out of it''? lt's my deal. l set it up.
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.
You like the ladies more than you like the money. That's your problem.
What the fuck are you talking about? l'm your partner, okay?
You're not gonna trust me with that kind of thing, who you gonna trust?
Junior partner.
Bullshit, man.
Hey, don't talk to me about trust. l don't like it.
You should listen to your wife.
She's right. You are an asshole, man!
Come here. Gimme a kiss.
Come here.
Hey. Hey!
Fuck you, man!
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!
Who do l trust? Me!
Fuck him. Trust.
Por nada.
Asshole.
Fuck called me an asshole. l need that shit. l don't need him, and l don't need her.
Fuck 'em. l don't need nobody!
Back then l worked in pictures down in Colombia.
Back then l worked in pictures down in Colombia. l was in that movie Burn.
You ever see it?
Ah, you saw me, with Marlon Brando.
You know, we're good friends.
l was his driver.
No shit?
Brando, huh?
Yeah, they shot it there.
Cartagena. They shot it there.
Yeah?
Gillo Pontecorvo. He was the director. ltalian guy.
Tell me about him.
Sure. l also worked-- l also know Paul Newman.
l worked with him in Tucson.
No kidding?
Hey, do you know Benny Ãlvarez?
They are in Tucson.
Benny Ãlvarez?
Subtotal.
No?
He's a nice guy.
You want a company check here?
[Clears Throat] l got 284.6.
That's just not possible.
The machine don't make mistakes.
Let's count it again.
No, no. Come on.
Business is business. Come on.
You're talking $1,500 here.
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay. l don't give a shit.
Well, l'll count it again for you.
No, no, come on.
This check here, where does this check go?
Montana Realty Company.
Montana what?
Montana Realty Company.
Montana Realty Company.
That's 284.
[Chi Chi] How come you don't know Benny Ãlvarez?
Me and Benny Ãlvarez have lunch together.
Yeah? He probably knows me.
You ask him.
[Men Yawning]
We're up to what?
Seven checks.
Two hundred thousand more, and we ought to take a leak.
Freeze!
Get 'em up! Get your hands against the wall and turn around.
You're not kidding.
You're under arrest for violation of the Rico Statute.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be taken against you.
Fuck you!
How do l know you guys are cops?
What's that say, asshole?
Oh, that pretty good, man.
Where'd you get that?
Â¡CabrÃ³n! You call yourself a Cuban?
You make a real Cuban throw up!
Call your dog off me, Seidelbaum.
l wanna call my lawyer.
Lotta good he's gonna do you.
You see that eye there in the clock?
Say, hi, honey.
Ah, that's pretty cute. Look at that.
He jerk off in front of us, Seidelbaum? l was supposed to meet this chick at 3:00. You're a fuckin' pain in the ass.
All right, Danny, kill it.
You understand the rights l've given you? l know all that bullshit, Seidelbaum!
Save your breath.
You got nothin' on me.
You know it! l know it! l'm changin' dollar bills, that's all.
You wanna waste my time?
Okay. l call my lawyer.
He's the best lawyer in Miami.
He's such a good lawyer, that by tomorrow morning, you gonna be working in Alaska.
So dress warm.
[Sheffield] Give me a check for a hundred grand, plus 300 in cash, and l guarantee you walk on the conspiracy charge.
But they're gonna come back at us on a tax evasion, and they'll get it.
So... what am l lookin' at here?
Five years.
You'll be out in three.
Maybe less, if l can make a deal.
Three fuckin' years!
For what?
Washing money? The fuckin' country was built on washed money.
lt can't be that bad. lt's not like Cuba.
What the fuck you talking?
The jails are like hotels.
You kidding me or what?
You fuckin' high or what?
l'll delay the trial.
A year and a half, two years.
You won't even start--
Hey, fuck you, man! l'm not going back in any cage, okay?
No way. l been there.
Okay, look.
[Clears Throat] l give you $400,000 more.
Okay, now that's $800,000.
With that kind of money, you can buy the Supreme Court.
Tony, the law has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. l'm an expert at raisin' that doubt.
But when you a got a million-three undeclared dollars... staring into a videotape camera, honey, baby, it's hard to convince a jury you found it in a taxicab.
[lce Cubes Rattle]
[Sosa] Tony.
Alex.
Tony, l'm so glad you could come on such short notice. l really appreciate it.
lt's okay.
How's Elvira?
Ah, great. How's your wife?
Three more months.
Oh, yeah? Congratulations.
How 'bout you?
When you gonna have another Tony to take your place?
l'm working on it.
You have to work harder. Come. l want you to meet some of my friends.
This is Pedro Quinn, chairman of the Andes Sugar Corporation.
Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Montana.
Nice to meet you.
General Edward Strasser, commander of the First Army Corps. Tony Montana.
Mucho gusto, amigo.
Pleasure.
This is Ariel Bleyer with the Ministry of the lnterior here. Tony Montana.
Bienvenido.
And here is our friend, Charles Goodson from Washington. This is Tony Montana.
How do you do?
How do you do, Mr. Montana?
[Sosa]
Sit here, Tony.
Gentlemen. l would like to discuss something that is of interest to all of us here.
You have a problem, Tony.
We... have a problem. l think together we can solve all our problems.
We all know that you have tax troubles in your country... and that you may have to do a little time.
But we have some friends in Washington that assure us these troubles can be taken care of.
You may have to pay some back taxes, a big fine, but, uh, there will be no prison.
Okay.
So what's your problem, Alex? l'll show you my problem.
[Reporter] l've heard whispers about financial support your government receives... from the drug industry in Bolivia.
Well, the irony of this is that this money, which is in the billions, is coming from your country.
You are the major purchaser of our national product, which is cocaine.
On one hand you're saying the United States government... is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets.
At the same time, we are doing business with the same government... that is flooding our streets with cocaine.
SÃ­. Let me show you a few of the other characters... that are involved in this tragicomedy.
My organization just recently traced a large purchase... by this man.
This charming face here belongs to General Cucombre.
He is the minister of the defense of Bolivia, my country.
And General Cucombre just a couple of months ago... bought a $12 million villa on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.
Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be the Bolivian defense minister, what is he doing living in Switzerland, guarding cash registers?
This man here,
Alejandro Sosa, a very interesting character.
He's a wealthy landowner, educated in England, very good family.
But this man is the business brain and drug overlord... of an empire that stretches across the Andes.
He's not your ordinary drug dealer.
[Reporter]
Well, discussing it openly--
[Tape Stops]
He is scheduled for 60 Minutes next.
He is going on French,
British, ltalian,
Japanese television.
People everywhere are starting to listen to him. lt's embarrassing, Tony.
Yeah.
That is our problem.
You remember Alberto, don't you?
How could l forget him?
Alberto is an expert in the disposal business.
He's going to help us fix our problem.
But he doesn't speak English.
He doesn't know his way around the States too well.
He needs a little help. ls that a problem, Tony?
No problem.
Good.
[People Chattering]
So what's the big mystery with the Bolivian situation?
You gonna tell me what happened with Sosa or what?
A lotta bullshit, that what happened.
[Laughs]
Politics.
Okay. l want you to stay down here for a while.
Run things for me. l gotta go to New York next week.
Okay?
[Clears Throat]
Fuck this, man. l don't like it, man. l don't like this at all.
You don't like it?
Okay.
You the one that got me into this mess in the first place, you know that?
Oh, yeah?
With that fuckin' Seidelbaum, that right?
With Seidelbaum? Man, what does
Seidelbaum have to do with Sosa?
How you connect those two?
[Sniffing]
Why don't you eat your food?
What's wrong with it?
l'm not hungry.
You're not hungry?
You even know about the trial?
What did you order it for then?
l lost my appetite.
Do you even know that Sheffield said he can get you a postponement?
[Manny] - Eh?
[Sniffing] ls this it? That's what it's all about, Manny?
Eating, drinking, fucking, sucking?
Come on, man. [Snickers]
Snorting?
Then what?
Tell me.
Then what?
You're 50.
You got a bag for a belly.
You got tits; you need a bra.
They got hair on 'em.
You got a liver, and they got spots on it, and you're eatin' this fuckin' shit, and you're lookin' like these rich fuckin' mummies in here.
Come on. lt's not so bad. lt could be worse.
ls this what it's all about?
Forget it.
This what l work for?
Tell me.
Â¡CoÃ±o!
Look at that.
A junkie. l got a fuckin' junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothin'.
Sleeps all day... with them black shades on.
