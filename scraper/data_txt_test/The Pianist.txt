The Pianist
Mr. Szpilman?\N- Hello.
I came specially to meet you.\NI love your playing.
Who are you?\N- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.
You're bleeding!\N- It's nothing.
You can write him a fan letter later.\NThis isn't the best time. Come on.
Jurek, where have you been\Nhiding her?
I don't know what to take.\N- You always take too much.
How many suitcases are you taking?
What do you think, should I take\Nuncle Szymon's portrait?
Take it, don't take it,\Ntake what you like.
Can't you see I'm worried sick?
He'll come home, he'll be alright.
I should have another case.\N- Mama, Wladek is home!
Thank God.\NWladek! You're wounded?
No, it was nothing.\N- I've been worried sick.
I told her not to worry.\NYou had your papers on you.
If you'd been hit by a bomb,\Nthey'd know where to take you.
Henryk, don't say things like that.\NGod forbid. God forbid.
Papa, Wladek is home.\N- What did I tell you?
What are you doing?\N- Where's my hat with the wide brim?
They've bombed us. We're off the air.\N- Warsaw is not the only radio station.
Pack, darling.\NGet your things packed.
Where are we going?\N- Out of Warsaw.
Out of Warsaw where?\N- You haven't heard?
Heard what?\N- Haven't you seen the paper?
Where's the paper?\N- I used it for packing.
She used it for packing.\N- The government has moved to Lublin.
All men must leave the city, go across\Nthe river, set up a new line of defense.
There isn't anybody left here, only\Nthe women. The men are all gone.
What do you think you'll do while\Nthey set up a new line of defense?
Wonder around with your suitcases?\N- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.
I'm not going anywhere.\N- Good. I'm not going anywhere either.
Don't be ridiculous,\Nwe've got to keep together.
Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to\Ndie in my own home, staying put.
God forbid.\N- Shut up, I've got something. Listen.
...from the BBC in London.\NThe British government... having received no reply\Nto the observations presented... to the German government... has declared war on nazi Germany.
That's wonderful! Wonderful!\N- It is expected that...
...within the next few hours, France\Nwill make a similar declaration.
Poland is no longer alone.
Wonderful, wonderful!
Mama, that was a great dinner.\N- It certainly was.
When there's something to celebrate,\Nyou've got to make an effort.
Here's to Great Britain and France!
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?\NAll will be well.
Five thousand and three.
Is that all?\N- Yes. It's all we've got left.
It's 3,003 too much.\N- Look.
"Further restrictions\Nregarding liquid assets.
Jews will be allowed to keep a\Nmaximum of 2,000 zlotys at home. "
What do we do with the rest?\N- Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough\Nto deposit money in a German bank?
We could hide the money. Look here.\NWe can hide it under the flowerpots.
I'll tell you what we'll do.\NWe'll use try and tested methods.
You know what we did\Nin the last war?
We made a hole in the table leg,\Nand hid the money in there.
Suppose they take the table away?\N- What do you mean?
Germans go into Jewish homes and\Ntake furniture, valuables, anything.
Do they?\N- Why'd they want a table like this?
What on earth are you doing?\N- Listen. Look.
This is the best place. No-one would\Nthink of looking under the flowerpot.
No, listen. I've been thinking...\N- Really? That's a change.
You know what? We use psychology.\N- We use what?
We leave the money and the watch\Non the table, covered. In full view.
Are you stupid?\N- The Germans will never notice it.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever\Nseen. Of course they'll notice. Look.
Look here.
Idiot.
And you call me stupid.\N- Very good. That's the last place...
This would take hours.\N- We're not in a hurry.
It won't take hours.\N- How will you get them out? Tell me.
How will you get them out?\N- Quiet! Order, please!
You reach them out individually.\N- No-one listens to me!
Quiet, please, quiet.\NOrder, order, please.
The lawyer, she likes order.\N- Listen, just listen. Look.
The watch we put under the flowerpot\Nand the money we stuff in the violin.
But I'll still be able to play?\N- You'll find out.
Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.\N- Wladek, how are you?
We're fine, thank you.\NAnd you?
Fine, under the circumstances.\NI guess I know why you're calling.
There's nothing we can do.\NThey won't reopen the station.
Yes, I know, but I...\N- No music, no radio for the Polish.
But sure you'll find work.\NA pianist like you.
Maybe, maybe not, but... don't be offended, but I didn't call\Nto discuss my future carrier.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,\Nand at last he gave in and said...
"All right, come with me tomorrow",\Nso I came and... they bombed the station.
Meeting you like that was wonderful.\N- Really?
Yes, it was unforgettable.
I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.\N- Call me Wladek, please.
No-one plays Chopin like you.\N- I hope it's a compliment.
Of course, I mean it.\N- I was... trying to be funny.
Should we go and have a coffee?\N- I'd like that.
And you, what do you do?\N- I finished with the conservatoire.
You're a musician?\N- Yes. But only just.
What instrument?\N- The cello.
I love to see women\Nplaying the cello.
JEWS FORBIDDEN
This is disgraceful.\NHow dare they?
You know what people are like, they\Nwant to be better nazis than Hitler.
I'm going in there to complain.\N- It's better not, believe me.
It's humiliating. Someone like you!\N- Good-bye.
We'll find somewhere else.
We can walk in the park.\N- No, we can't.
Official decree.\NNo Jews allowed in the park.
My God. Are you joking?\N- I'm not joking, it's true.
We could sit in a bench, but\N"no Jews allowed on public benches".
This is absurd.
We can just stand here and talk.\NI think we're allowed to do that.
So, you play the cello. That's nice.\NAnd who's your favorite composer?
Chopin? Really? Well... you'll have to learn to play\Nhis cello sonata, won't you?
What about you, Wladek?
Perhaps I could accompany.\NMe on the piano, you on the cello.
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,\Nquite wonderful.
Call me Wladek, please.
"Free emblems for Jews\Nin the Warsaw district.
I hereby order that all Jews\Nin the Warsaw district... will wear visible emblems\Nwhen out of doors.
This decree will come into force\Non the first of December, 1939... and applies to all Jews\Nover 12 years of age.
The emblem will be worn\Non the right sleeve... and will represent the blue star\Nof David on a white background.
The background must be\Nsufficiently large... for the star to measure eight\Ncentimeters from point to point.
The width of the arms of the star\Nmust be one centimeter.
The Jews that do not respect this\Ndecree will be severely punished.
Governor of the Warsaw district,\NDr. Fischer. "
I won't wear it.\N- I'm not going to be branded.
Let me see this.
Does it say that we have to provide\Nthese armbands ourselves?
Where will we get them?\N- We're not going to wear them.
You!
Come here.
Why haven't you greeted us?
I'm sorry.
The sidewalk is forbidden for you.
Go to the gutter.
Have you seen this?\N- What? What? I'm working. What?
What is this?
It's where they're going to put us.\N- What do you mean "put us"?
"By order of the governor of the\NWarsaw district, Dr. Fischer... concerning the establishment of\Nthe Jewish district in Warsaw.
There'll be created a Jewish district\Nin which Jews will have to reside. "
Look here. "Jews living outside\Nof the prescribed area... will have to move to the Jewish\Ndistrict by 31 of October, 1940."
They won't get all of us.\NIt's too small.
There's 400 thousand of us\Nin Warsaw.
No, 360 thousand.\NSo it will be easy.
What am I supposed to do?\NYou tell me.
Mama?
Mama, what is it?
20 zlotys!
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,\Npotatoes, potatoes.
That's the price.\NThat's what I'm offering.
My advice is to accept.\NYou won't get more from anyone else.
But it's a Bechstein!\N- 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.
What are you going to do when\Nyou're hungry? Eat the piano?
Get out!\N- What's the matter with you?
Stop it!\N- We'd rather give it away. Get out!
Haven't you eaten today?\NWhat are you suffering from?
You people are crazy.
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand\Nand I'm paying for the removal.
I'm not even charging\Nfor the removal!
You haven't eaten today.\NYou're crazy.
Take it.
Hello.
Hello. Hi.
I didn't want to come.
I didn't want to see all this, but...\NI couldn't stop myself.
How are you doing?\N- Fine.
Good.
No, not really.\NThey arrested my cousin.
Jurek says they'll let him out.
This is disgraceful.\N- It won't last long. Don't worry.
That's what I said myself.
It's too absurd.
I... I should go.
Well, I'll see you... soon.
Good-bye.
Well... to tell you the truth,\NI thought it would be worse.
Where will we sleep?\N- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.
You, Henryk and papa, in here.
Look.
Come and look.
Go away.
Go away! Go away!
Papa! Papa!
Sell anything?\N- Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".
3 zlotys.\N- It's better than yesterday.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are\Npeople there making millions.
I know.\N- You don't know, believe me.
They bribe the guards,\Nthe guards turn a blind eye.
They bring cartloads of food,\Ntobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.
And the poor are dying all around\Nand they don't give a damn.
Excuse me, have you seen\Nmy husband, Izaak Szerman?
A tall handsome man,\Nwith a little gray beard.
I'm afraid not.\N- Excuse me. Good-bye.
Sleep well. But if you see him,\Nwrite to me, yes?
Izaak Szerman.
Why do we have to have a gentile\Nstreet running through our area?
Why can't they go around?
Don't worry. They're about to build\Na bridge. Haven't you heard?
A bridge! Those idiots.
The Germans claim to be intelligent.
But do you know what I think?\NI think they're totally stupid.
I have a family to feed.\NI spend half of my time here... waiting for them to let us through.
Maybe they think I come here\Nto listen to the music?
What is it? Are you in a hurry?\N- What's wrong with you?
Come on, do something.\N- Right. Dance!
Dance!\N- Dance!
Come on, come on! Dance!
Very well.
What about you?\NDance with him.
Let's clear the street,\Nso the Jews can dance.
Come on. And you.
Go on.
Faster!
Come on!
Faster!
Come on!
Faster!
Come on, move! I said faster!\NCome on, Jews!
Keep dancing.\N- Dance.
Good, they're here.
Itzak Heller has been\Nwaiting for you.
What's this about?\N- Sit down, have tea.
I'll start lunch\Nwhen the girls get here.
So, what are you doing here?\N- He brought cakes.
His father is back in the jewellery\Nbusiness. He's doing well.
Amazing, jewellery.
We're recruiting.\N- Who is recruiting?
Don't be clever with me.\NI'm coming as a friend.
They're bringing Jews in\Nfrom all over the country.
Soon there will be half million people\Nin the ghetto.
We need more Jewish police.\N- More Jewish police!
You want me to beat up Jews\Nand catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.
Someone has got to do it.\N- But why me?
I thought you only recruited boys\Nwith rich fathers.
Look at my father, look at us...
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm\Nhere. You can have a better life.
You want to survive selling books?\N- Yes, please.
I'm doing you people a favor.
What about you?\NYou're a great pianist.
We've got a police jazz band.\NThey'd welcome you with open arms.
Join us. You've got no work.\N- Thank you, I've got work.
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.
Who wants me to stop?
I always say,\Nlook on the bright side.
You're in a small ghetto with\Nintellectuals, professional people.
You're better off than us. Here in\Nthe large ghetto it's a cesspool.
You have to give me something.\N- You're an artist... you keep peoples' spirits up.\NYou do enough.
I want to help, do something.\N- You're too well known.
And you know what? You musicians\Ndon't make good conspirators.
You're too... too musical.
Who is that?\N- Symche.
Majorek.
There are notices going up. City is\Nto be cleansed of the undesirables.
There's always notices going up.\N- Hello, Symche.
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.
Jehuda, working hard?
This is the greatest pianist in\NPoland. Maybe the whole world.
Wladyslaw Szpilman,\Nmeet Majorek.
How do you do?\N- I know your name.
I've never heard you play.\N- Majorek used to be in the Army.
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got\Nagainst him is he's not a socialist.
You better go now, Wladek.\NIt's nearly curfew.
You know how many copies\Nwe print of our newspaper?
Five hundred.
You know how many people on\Naverage read one copy? Twenty.
That makes 10 thousand readers.\NThis will start the uprising.
Majorek hides them in his underpants\Nand leaves them in toilets.
Toilets?\N- As many toilets as I can find.
Germans never use Jewish toilets.
They're too clean for them.
Please, mister, please.
Hold it!\NYou little bastard!
Take this!
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!
Come on, come on.\NCome on, boy.
Stand up! Stand up.
Please, tonight for once, I don't\Nwant anything bad talked about.
Enjoy your meal.\N- Then I'll tell you something funny.
You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?\N- The surgeon.
The Germans allowed him into\Nthe ghetto to perform an operation.
On a Jew? They let a Pole\Nto come in to operate on a Jew?
He got a pass, that's all I know.\NAnyway, so... he puts the patient to sleep\Nand starts the operation.
He'd just made the first incision\Nwhen the SS burst in... shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja\Nand everybody else who was there.
Isn't that a laugh?
The patient didn't feel a thing,\Nhe was anesthetized.
I said nothing bad.
What's the matter with you all?\NYou lost your sense of humor?
It's not funny.
You know what's funny? You're\Nfunny, with that ridiculous tie.
What are you talking about? What's\Nmy tie have to do with anything?
I need this tie for my work.\N- Your work?
That's right, I work.\N- Playing the piano for the parasites.
Parasites...\N- Boys. Boys!
They don't give a damn.\N- And you blame me for their apathy?
I see it everyday. They don't even\Nnotice what's going around them.
I blame the Americans.\N- For what? For my tie?
The American Jews,\Nand there are lots of them.
What do they think they're doing?\NPeople here are dying.
Haven't got a bite to eat.
The Jewish bankers should persuade\NAmerica to declare war on Germany.
The lights! The lights!
Turn on the lights.
Come on!
Open the door!\NWe want to go in!
Open the door!
Stand up!
You, stand up! Come on!
Throw him out!
Mama...
Come on, run!
I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.\N- Go in. Not you.
What?\N- Come. It's terrible.
What?\N- They're hunting people in the streets.
They've taken Henryk.
Go home, alright? Go home,\NI'll take care of it.
Excuse me. Have you seen\Nmy husband? Izaak Szerman?
I'm afraid not.\N- Tall, handsome, little gray beard.
If you see him, write to me.\NDon't forget. Izaak Szerman.
What happened here?
They've got my grandson. They\Npick them up and take them away.
What they do to them,\NI've stopped believing in God.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Itzak?
Itzak?
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.
Henryk is in there.\N- I haven't seen him.
Believe me.\NThey picked him up.
Can you help?\N- Now you need me. Now you need me!
Can you help us?
It costs.\N- I have no money.
Then there's nothing I can do.\NYou should have joined us.
They told me you had influence.\N- Who told you?
People I know. They said\Nyou're an important man.
Itzak...
Hands up.\N- How are you?
How are you?\N- You, bandit.
Dead! Dead!
He's crazy.\N- Hands up.
Want a cigarette?\N- Cigarette?
Thank you.
Everything is alright!
He looks very happy.
Everything is alright.
Everything is alright.
Hands up! Hands up!
It's alright.
Help! Help!
Let go! Help!
Why did they pick you up?\N- So you go to Itzak Heller?
Did I ask you to talk to him?\N- You're out, aren't you?
Did you beg to that piece of shit?\N- I asked him to help you.
What did you pay him?
With what could I pay him? Every\Nzloty I earn we spend on food.
I can look after myself.\N- They were taking you away.
It's got nothing to do with you.\NIt's me they wanted, not you.
Why do you have to interfere\Nwith other people's business?
You're mad. That's your trouble.\N- That's also my business.
What's the matter?\NAre you sick?
Hungry.
Employment certificate. What's that\Nmean, no employment certificate?
You have to have an\Nemployment certificate... to work for the Germans\Nin the ghetto, otherwise...
Otherwise what?\N- You'll be deported.
So the rumors were true.\N- They're going to resettle us... and send us to labor camps,\Nin the East.
They're closing the small ghetto.\N- Oh, God!
Wladek? Wladek?
I thought you were on tour playing\Nin London, Paris, New York, Chicago.
Not this week.\N- You look terrible.
Have you heard the rumors? They're\Ngoing to resettle us in the East.
Rumors! You take it all too much\Nto heart. What's the trouble?
I've been trying to get the certificate\Nof employment for my father.
I managed to get one for me and my\Nfamily, but I need one for my father.
I've been to all the firms and shops...\N- Why didn't you come to me?
I didn't know you were\Nin the certificate business.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Can you help?\NI have no money.
Please, don't insult us.\NCan you do something for him?
Be at the Schultz workshop\Ntomorrow, four o'clock.
See what a wonderful piece\Nof luck you've had today?
That's the historical imperative in\Naction! That's why I always say:
"Look on the bright side!"\N- Yes, I know.
How's your back?\N- Better.
Better?
Better not ask.
Thank you.\N- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.
At least we got work\Nin the ghetto.
At least we are still together.
Everybody out!\NTo the courtyard!
Move, move!
We are workers. We have\Nemployment certification.
Wait.
Here.
Go over there. Hurry.
You.
You. You.
You.
You.
You.
The others, put your clothes on\Nand come back here.
Bring your things with you.\N15 kilos only.
Where are you taking us?
I'm sorry, I did my best.
I thought the certificates'd save us.\N- Stop it, Wladek.
Let's just hope that Henryk\Nand Halina will be better off.
Where will we be going?\N- You're going to work.
You'll be much better off than\Nin the stinking ghetto. Move.
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?\NWhy did I do it?
Why did I do it?
Don't you have a bottle of water?\NHe's dying.
My child is dying of thirst.
I beg you.\N- I'm sorry.
Don't you have water? I beg you.\N- Can you hear what I'm saying?
I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.\N- I can hear you.
Letting them take us to our death\Nlike sheep to the slaughter.
Not so loud.\N- Why don't we attack them?
There's half a million of us here.\NWe can break out of the ghetto.
At least we can die honorably, not\Nas a stain on the face of History.
Why are you so sure they're\Nsending us to our death?
You know why I'm not sure?\NBecause they didn't tell me.
They're going to wipe us all out.\N- What do you want me to do? Fight?
To fight, we need organization,\Nplans, guns.
He's right. Do you think I'm going\Nto fight with my violin bowl?
The Germans would never squander\Na huge labor force like this.
They're sending us to a labor camp,\Nit's obvious.
Sure.
Look at that cripple, the old people,\Nthe children. They're going to work?
Look at you. You're going to carry\Nlogs on your back?
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!
I missed you.\NI wanted to be with you!
I wanted to be with you!
Stupid. Stupid.
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
She's getting on my nerves.
What did she do, for God's sake?\N- She smothered her baby.
They prepared a hiding place\Nand of course they went there.
The baby cried\Njust as the police came.
She smothered the cries with\Nher hands, the baby died.
A policeman heard the death rattle\Nand found where they were hiding.
What are you reading?
"If you prick us, de we not bleed?\NIf you tickle us, do we not laugh?
If you poison us, do we not die?
And, if you wrong us,\Nshall we not revenge?"
Very appropriate.\N- Yes. That's why I brought it.
Idiot. What does he think\Nhe's gonna do with the money?
Boy, come here.
Come here.
How much for a caramel?\N- 20 zlotys.
For one caramel? What do you think\Nyou're gonna do with the money?
20 zlotys.
We've got 20 between us.
I've got 10, I think.
Halina?\N- What?
It's a funny time to say this, but...\N- What?
I wish I knew you better.
Thank you.
Szpilman?
Papa? Papa?
Mama? Halina?
Halina? Mama?
What do you think you're doing?\NI've saved your life. Just go! Go!
Don't run!
Anna!
Anna!
Off they go to the melting pot.
This stays.\N- Give it to me!
What are you doing?\NShe's pregnant.
Wladek?
Why are you here, Wladek?
It's like this, I...
We...
All of them, all of them.
All of them.
Perhaps they're lucky.\NThe quicker, the better.
It's not finished yet. We'll stay\Nhere for a couple of days... until things die down.
I've bribed the policeman,\Nhe'll come when it's over.
Attention!\NOn the march!
Onward!
My God, I haven't been outside in,\Nit must be two years.
Don't get overexcited.
It's gold.\NVery good price.
Someone you know?
A beauty.\NWho is she?
She's a singer. I knew her well.\NHer husband is an actor.
They're good people.\NI'd like to talk to her.
Don't forget, Wladek.\NThey hang them for helping Jews.
Turn left!
On the march!
Stop! Halt!\NAttention!
At ease.
Turn right!
Step forward.
You.
You. You.
You.
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!
Turn left!
On the march.
How long have you been here?
Since last night.
I was pleased to see you.
They're going to start\Nthe final resettlement now.
We know what it means.
We sent someone out.\NZygmund, a good man.
His orders were to follow\Nthe trains out of Warsaw.
He got to Sokolow.
A man told him the tracks divided,\None branch's leading to Treblinka.
He said everyday freight trains\Ncarrying people from Warsaw... branch off to Treblinka\Nand return empty.
No transports of food\Nare ever seen on that line.
The civilians are forbidden\Nto approach the Treblinka station.
They're exterminating us.
It won't take them long.
We are 60 thousand left,\Nout of half a million.
Mostly young people.
And this time we're gonna fight.
We're in good shape.
Organized.\NWe're prepared.
If you need help, I...
You! Come here!
Shit!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Take this! Take this!
Take him away.
I hope you play the piano better\Nthan you carry bricks.
He won't last long\Nif he goes on like this.
I'll see if I can get him\Nsomething better.
Trouble.
Round up only the Jews!
Round up!\NOnly the Jews.
The Polish keep working.\NOnly the Jews.
I have good news for you.
There are rumors going around\Nthat we like to... to resettle you.
I promise you that now\Nand in the future... nothing else is planned.
For this reason, we put\Ninformation posters on the wall.
To show you our goodwill... you should vote one of you\Nto be allowed... to go in town daily... and bring 3 kilos of potatoes... and one loaf of bread\Nfor each of your workers.
So, why should we do something\Nlike this if we'd resettle you?
You can make good business\Nout of the things you don't eat.
Isn't that something that you Jews\Nare good in? Making money?
Dismiss them.
That one, with the string.\NThe others, tied by wire.
Now!
Majorek.
I have a favor to ask.
I want to get out of here.
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll\Nsurvive on the other side that's hard.
I know.
Last summer, I worked for a day\Nin the Zelazna Brama Square.
I saw someone I knew,\Nshe's an old friend.
A singer, her husband\Nis an actor.
I've filled their names down and\Ntheir address, if they're still there.
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej\NBogucki. They're good people.
Would you try to make contact?
You go to town everyday. Ask them\Nif they'd help me get out of here.
Have you got any plaster?
What are you up to?
What have you got there?
We are allowed to take\Nfood to the ghetto.
Three kilos of potato and bread.
Open it.
It's only potatoes and bread.\N- You're lying. That's not true.
Open it.
Potatoes!
You Jews are all alike.
We reach you with a finger... and you take the whole hand.
If you lie to me again,\NI'll kill you. Personally.
I've tried your friends.
They don't live there anymore.\N- Did you make contact?
Be ready to leave.\N- When?
Soon.\N- Halt!
Shit! Shit!
Wait. What's going on here?
Take this! Take this!
I'll teach you some discipline,\Nyou dirty Jews.
Do you know why\Nyou're being hit?
No.\N- Do you know why you're being hit?
Why?\N- To celebrate New Year.
On the march!
March and sing!
Sing something nice!
Loud and clear!
Reunite tonight\NAnd follow the white eagle
Stand up and fight\NOur mortal enemies
Rise on the day\NLet's give them fire and brimstone
We'll do away\NThe Yoke of slavery
Punish and rout\NThe rapists of our nation
We'll slash them out\NTo save our dignity
Come.
I'm sorry.
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.
We haven't much time.\NCome on.
We must hurry.
Here. See if this fit.
We have to keep moving you. Germans\Nare hunting down indiscriminately.
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.
You better shave.\NUse my razor on the shelf.
You'll be looked after\Nby Gebczynski.
He's on the other side of town.
You stay there tonight,\Nthen we'll find you somewhere else.
I'll bring you food.\N- Alright, let's go.
I'll show you where\Nyou're going to sleep.
You have to stay here\Nuntil tomorrow afternoon.
We have a flat for you near\Nthe ghetto wall. But it's safe.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'll be fine.
Thank you.
Here. Here. Give it to me.
Go as near to the front as possible,\Nto the German section.
DO NOT PASS
I'm going to draw the curtains now.
But you leave them open\Nduring the day. Don't forget.
Must feel better on\Nthis side of the wall, eh?
Yes.
But sometimes I'm still not sure\Nwhich side of the wall I'm on.
Some bread, potatoes, onions.
I'll come again.\NJanina will visit you twice a week.
To bring more food,\Nsee how you are.
Thank you.
This is very important.\NIn case of emergency...
I mean emergency,\Ngo to this address.
What do you mean you forgot?
What do you think I mean?\NI forgot, that's what I mean.
You know, you treat me like dirt.\N- Because you are a dirt.
Pig! Pig!\N- Bitch!
Dirty pig!\N- You are a dirty pig!
Takes one to know one. Pig.
You play like an angel.\N- Then why don't you listen?
I'm listening.\N- Liar.
You fell asleep. Pig.
Spread out!\NWe're being attacked!
Take cover!
Shoot!
Take cover! Fire!
Come on, get out!
The attack was successful.
That building...
Turn that way!
Shoot!
Thank you.
I wanted to come earlier, but...\N- No, thank you.
No-one thought\Nthey'd hold out so long.
I never should've come out. I should\Nhave stayed and fought with them.
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.
Just be proud of them.
My God, did they put up a fight!\N- Yes.
So did the Germans.\N- They are in shock!
They didn't expect it. Nobody\Nexpected it. Jews fighting back.
Who would have thought?\N- What good did it do?
What good?
Wladek, I'm surprised with you.
They died with dignity.\NAnd you know something else?
Now the Poles will rise.\NWe are ready.
We'll fight too.\NYou'll see.
Get your things together.\NYou have to leave.
What? What's happened?
I'm on the run.\N- What's happened?
The Gestapo found our weapons.\NThey've arrested Janina and Andrzej.
They're bound to find out about this\Nplace too. You must get away at once.
Where do you want me to go?
Look at me, I'm not leaving.
Can I take my chances here?\N- That's your decision.
But when they storm the flat,\Nthrow yourself out the window... don't let them get you alive.
I have poison on me.\NThey won't get me alive either.
Open up!
Open the door\Nor we'll call the police!
Are you from this flat?\NYou're not registered.
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just\Ncame to visit, but I missed him.
Have you got your identity card?
Let me see your identity card.\N- Yes, of course.
I want to see your identity card!\N- What's happening?
He's a Jew! A Jew!
Stop the Jew!
Don't let him out!\NStop him!
Yes?\N- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.\N- Dorota.
Come in.
I'm sorry.
I was given this address and\NI'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.
Come in.
Sit.
I need help.
He'll be back before curfew.
I've been in hiding.
I need somewhere to stay.\N- He'll be here soon.
How long have you been married?\N- Just over a year.
And how is Jurek?
Dead.
When is your baby due?\N- Christmas.
This is not a good time to\Nhave children, but then...
This is my husband.\NWladyslaw Szpilman.
Marek Gebczynski sent him.\N- Yes, I remember.
He said to contact you\Nonly in case of emergency.
Don't worry now.
We can't move you tonight.\NYou'll sleep on the sofa.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry,\Ncould I have a piece of bread?
Yes, of course.\NWe will eat.
Sit. Please, sit.
Thank you.
You're on a very German area.
On the opposite is a hospital taking\Nwounded from the Russian front.
And next door is the\NSchutzpolizei.
Safest place to be.
Right at the heart\Nof the lion's den.
I'll be locking you in.
No-one knows you're here,\Nso keep as quiet as possible.
All well?
Thank you.
This is Antek Szalas.\NHe'll be looking after you.
How do you do?\N- How do you do?
Thank you.
I've given him a second key. He'll\Nbring food, see that you're alright.
He's with the underground,\Nhe's a good man.
You don't remember me?\N- I don't think so.
Warsaw Radio.\NI was a technician.
I saw you almost everyday.
I'm sorry, I don't remember.\N- It doesn't matter.
You've nothing to worry about.\NI'll visit often.
You'll be pleased to hear that\Nthe Allies are bombing Germany... night after night,\Nafter night.
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.
And the Russians are giving them\Nhell. It's the beginning of the end.
Let's hope so.
Come here.
Be careful with it.
That's it. Be careful.
Still alive then?
Here. Sausage, bread.
You still got that vodka?
How long is this meant to last?\N- Not long now.
I think I've got jaundice.
Don't worry about that.\NIt just makes you look funny.
My grandfather was jilted by\Nhis girlfriend when he got jaundice.
Drink up.
Why didn't you come sooner?\NIt's been over two weeks...
Problems.
Money.
I've got to raise money\Nto buy the food.
I need things to sell,\Nit's not easy.
Here. Sell this.
Food is more important than time.
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!\NThe Allies have landed in France.
Russians will be here soon.
They'll beat the shit\Nout of the Germans... any day now.
Wladek?
I knew it.\NI knew this would happen.
I'll get a doctor.\N- You can't. It's too dangerous.
Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.\N- Ridiculous. He's a pediatrician.
He's still a doctor.\N- No.
You stay. I'll go.
We came to say goodbye.
We're going to stay\Nwith my mother in Otwocks.
The baby is already there.\NIt's safer.
There's talk that the uprising\Nwill begin any day now.
That man Szalas should be shot.
He's been collecting money\Non your behalf all over Warsaw.
Apparently people gave generously,\Nso he collected a tidy sum.
My God.
The liver the size of a football.\NInflammation of the gall bladder... but he'll leave.
I'll try to get him some laevulose,\Nbut it's not easy.
Can you visit him again?\N- Who knows.
Doctor, thank you.\N- Don't speak, rest.
Thank you so much for coming.
We've brought you some food.
I'll prepare something now\Nfor you, then we must go.
I'll throw a grenade!
There's a wounded man over there!
Come.
Watch out! Watch out!
I'll go get help!\N- Hurry!
Come on! Bring the litter!
Go back inside!
Get out, get out in the streets!
Get out now! The Germans\Nhave surrounded the building!
Somebody...\NSomebody help me!
Are you alright?\NThere's too much dust.
I'll check this side.\NDon't worry.
Be careful!
Heinrich?\N- I'm checking!
Is there anybody here?
Come on down!\N- Alright, I'm coming.
Come on, pile them up.
Throw it.
We have to mark everything.
Come on.
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
Do you understand?\N- Yes.
What are you doing?
I was... trying to open this can.
Do you live here?
Do you work here?
No.
What do you do for a living?
I am...
I was a pianist.
Pianist?
Come.
Play something.
Are you hiding here?
Jew?
Where are you hiding yourself?
In the attic.
Show it to me.
Have you got anything to eat?
According to them,\Nit's very important that...
Attention!
At ease.\N- At ease.
Jew?
Please.
What does it mean,\Nall that shooting?
The Russians,\Non the other side of the river.
You just have to hold on\Na couple of weeks, not more.
What's going on?\N- We're leaving.
Are the Russians here?\N- Not yet.
I don't know how to thank you.
Thank God, not me.
He wants us to survive. At least,\Nwe have to believe in that.
Here. Take it.
And you?\N- I have another one. Warmer.
What are you going to do\Nwhen this is over?
I'll play piano again at\Nthe Polish radio station.
Tell me your name.
Maybe I'll listen to you playing.
Szpilman.
Perfect name for a pianist.
German! German!
Don't shoot, I'm Polish!
I'm Polish!
Come out with your hands up!\N- Please! I beg of you!
Don't shoot, don't shoot.\NI beg you, I'm a Polish.
Come down!
Please, I'm Polish.\NPlease.
He's Polish.
Yes, he's Polish.
Why the fucking coat?
I'm cold.
Look at them.\NGerman fuckers!
Murderers! Murderers!
Dirty bastards!\N- Assassins!
Bastards!\N- Look at you now!
You took everything I had.\NMe, a musician.
You took my violin,\Nyou took my soul.
Musician?
Are you a musician?
Do you know... a pianist called Szpilman,\Nfrom the Polish radio station?
Of course I know him.\N- I helped him to hide himself.
Tell him I'm here.
Ask him to help me.
What's your name?\N- Hosenfeld.
What?
It was here, I'm certain of it.
Well, it's not here now.
I shouted, abused them. I'm not\Nproud of it, but that's what I did.
I stood where you are now.
There was a barbed wire\Nand this German came up to me.
You didn't catch his name?\N- No.
I'll ask at the factory.\NThey may know something.Biography, Drama, Music
