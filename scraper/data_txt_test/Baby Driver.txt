Stay there!
Don't you move!
Get down!
Don't fucking move!
Let's go!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Nobody move!
Nobody move!

Next customer.
Next customer.
Oh, uh...
Can I take your order?
Uh...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll have, uh, four black coffees, medium.
Name?
Baby.
"Baby"?
B-A-B-Y, Baby.
Could you pass that? âª Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh âª Oh, oh...
Baby.
Subaru WRX believed to be connected to the robbery... âª Hitchhike, baby âª Across the floor âª Whoa, whoa, whoa âª I can't stand it no more
The river of sin.
Sin is your enemy.
Sin can be washed away if you just find God.
Don't walk away from your sin. âª Now, get into your slide âª We're gonna ride, ride, ride âª Little pony, ride...
Is she in there?
I told you, no.
I can't deal with you right now. âª Shake, shake, shake âª Shake a tail feather, baby
Be on time. âª Whoo! âª Shake, shake, shake a tail feather, baby... âª
It is believed that the robbers have escaped with upwards of $200,000.
What's his deal?
Baby?
Full cut, same as everyone.
No, Doc,
I mean is he, uh, retarded?
"Retarded" means slow.
Was he slow?
No.
Then he don't sound that retarded to me.
He's a good kid and a devil behind the wheel.
What the hell else more do you need to know?
So you don't think that there's something wrong with him just not saying anything?
There's nothing wrong with a little quiet.
You know why they call him Baby, right?
Still waiting on his first words.
So, you're a mute, Baby?
Is that what it is?
God.
Are you a mute?
No.
So, um, what are you listening to?
Uh, music.
That's right.
You tell him, Baby.
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.
For God's sakes, Griff, leave the kid alone.
You can't just be in crime, right?
Not without being a little criminal.
I just want to find out what's going on between those ears, aside, of course, from, uh...
Egyptian Reggae.
What's it matter to you?
Just think that he thinks he's better than us.
He wants to sit there in his car and keep his white shirt clean while the rest of us, we roll in the dirt.
One of these days, Baby, you're gonna get blood on your hands, and you're gonna find out that that shit don't wash off in the fucking sink.
Relax. The kid did his job, all right?
I ever say that the kid wasn't great at his job? No.
I think he's a star.
Would I vouch for him if he wasn't?
Got to hand it to you, totem pole, you're either hard as nails or scared as shit.
Which one is it?
What do you think about that, Baby?
Mommy and Daddy are getting it on.
Enough.
Yeah, where do you get off?
Right...
Here.
Okay, folks, if you don't see me again, it's 'cause I'm dead.
Tell me about tonight, Buddy.
Tonight, Darling, we will have post-heist revelry at Bacchanalia.
Why, that is the finest winin' and dinin' of all the wines and dines in town.
Ah, that's us.
Bye.
Well, sir, expect the lady and myself to darken your door once the nose bag is empty.
And, Baby, you did good, kid.
Do me a favor.
Next time Doc calls, don't pick up.
Don't listen to him.
Now, I get absolutely no pleasure in taking candy from Baby, but we're fast approaching the day when you...
Will be all paid up.
One more job and I'm done?
One more job and we're straight.
Sound good?
Oh...
I was gonna wait until we were square, but what the hell.
These are for you.
Now give me your burner.
I'm gonna need you behind the wheel again real soon.
You call, I'm there.
Here's what we know.
Two men and a woman came into the bank branch clad in black business clothing, trench coats, bandanas and sunglasses.
They pulled guns and ordered everybody to the floor, and then cleaned out the registers.
And hear this, they even swiped jewelry from some of the customers.
You awake?
They ran out of the bank to a waiting getaway car.
A driver was there to take them away.
It was a red...
You hungry?
Always.
You got it.
Spread to the edges!
...is a young Caucasian male.
His identity remains as yet unknown, and police are appealing to anyone who might recognize him to come forward.
The search for the suspect is ongoing.
Police pursued the getaway vehicle across downtown Atlanta and I-85 by helicopter.
Where is that cash from?
Work.
One more job.
Then I'm done.
You don't belong in that world.
Sorry, couldn't hear you.
I have a banana in my ear.
You heard me. âª You are so beautiful... âª
They grow up so freaking fast, don't they?
You and I are a team.
Nothing is more important than our friendship.
How's that working out for you?
And still the bull stands, bloodied but unrelenting.
Gaston is running out of time.
He's had his tries from horseback.
Now he must try to end this on foot.
"Retarded" means slow.
Was he slow?
No.
Was he slow?
No.
Was he slow?
No.
"Retarded" means slow.
Was he slow?
No.
"Retarded" means slow.
Was he slow?
No.
...slow? ...slow? ...slow? âª Was... Was he slow? âª No... N-no âª Was he slow? âª De...
Devil behind the wheel âª Was he slow? âª No... N-N-No âª Good... Good kid and a devil-devil-devil behind the wheel âª Was he slow? âª âª Temperature goes sky-high âª You know I really don't want to help it âª B-A-B-Y, baby âª B-A-B-Y, baby âª Whenever the sun don't shine âª âª B-A-B-Y, baby âª
So, what can I get you this fine morning?
Uh...
Oh, don't worry if you need a second.
I have all the time in the world.
Whoa, are you recording this?
Oh, uh...
Am I being monitored for quality assurance?
No. I... I...
No.
Um, hello? Hello, testing.
What can I get you this fine morning, sir?
Um...
Oh, um, you know that's a kid's menu, right?
Yeah, oh.
I get it. It's early.
So you just starting your day or did you just get off?
Oh, I don't know if I ever get off.
They call, I go, you know?
So, what is it you do?
I'm a driver.
Oh, like a...
Like a chauffeur.
You drive around important people?
I guess I do.
Anyone I'd know?
I hope not.
Well, aren't you mysterious.
Maybe.
Maybe?
So, when was the last time you hit the road just for fun?
Yesterday.
Oh, then I'm jealous.
Sometimes all I want to do is head west on 20 in a car I can't afford with a plan I don't have.
Just me, my music and the road.
I'd like that, too.
Oh.
Uh, so, you decide on anything yet?
You are so beautiful.
You just decided that.
Oh, well, thank you.
I'm sure you don't mean it.
I do mean it.
Jonathan?
Oh, sorry.
You know, this isn't my badge.
I've only just started here, so...
As a Jonathan?
Yeah. As a Jonathan.
Well, um, if you have any more questions, just holler. âª B-A-B-Y, baby âª
I have a question.
What's that song you're singing? âª Baby, oh, baby âª I love to call you baby âª Baby, oh, baby âª I love for you to call me baby âª When you squeeze me real tight...
I approve.
Of the song?
Of the girl. âª And I can't stop loving you âª And I won't stop calling you âª Baby, oh, baby âª You look so good to me, baby âª
Oh, there you are.
I've been calling, Baby.
You have?
I have.
My chicken just laid a very big egg.
You in?
Am I in?
It was a rhetorical question, Baby.
You're in.
I'll be there.
Meet your new crew.
Over here is Eddie No Nose, formerly Eddie The Nose.
Why, what happened?
Don't ask me that.
That's a No Nose no-no, page one.
And right here is JD.
He put the "Asian" in home invasion.
And over there is the one and the only Bats.
No need for intros, Doc.
Everybody from the jungle to the trap know Bats.
This your boy, right?
This the one you say listens to the music all the time?
The driver's supposed to be the eyes and the ears, not just the eyes.
Why does he listen to music all the time, Doc?
He's got mental problems?
No, no, no, no.
I'm the one got the mental problems in the crew.
Position taken.
He's got tinnitus.
Tinna-what?
He had an accident when he was a kid.
He's still got a hum in the drum.
Plays music to drown it out.
Yeah, but you feel me.
Hat?
Huh?
Your tattoo says, "Hat."
Yeah. It used to say "Hate."
But to increase my chances of employment, I got the "E" removed.
How's that working out for you?
Who doesn't like hats?
So, Doc, how many jobs you done with the kid?
If you can't take my word for him, then get back in that fucking elevator.
You never heard of the Spirit of 85?
The joyrider?
Yeah.
The ghost that baited cops doing 130 on 85.
Headlights off, brake lights disconnected.
He drove 'em around in circles on Spaghetti Junction.
Left 'em in the dust every time.
That was our boy there.
Wasn't that, like, 10 years ago?
Yeah.
Well, like I said, that was our boy.
He's been boosting cars since he was old enough to see over the dash.
He stole my Mercedes.
Had a lot of merch in it.
I watched him do it, too.
I didn't stop him, though,
'cause I was just blinded by the balls on that kid.
'Course he didn't know who I was, or the worth of the junk in the trunk once he dumped it, but once I tracked him down,
I made sure to tell him who I was, what I was capable of, and how much he owed me.
And since he's been paying me back, he's also shown me what he's capable of.
Wow.
I just drew a whole goddamn map in chalk while we've been standing here squawking.
That's pretty fucking impressive, right?
Shop, let's talk it.
Baby, you with us?
Bank robbers. Whatever.
It's got to be ready for an 8:30 start in the a.m.
Questions?
I got a question, Doc.
Why would I believe Phones over here heard a goddamn word you said?
You laid down your whole play.
He ain't even listening.
Baby?
The target is an armored truck at Perimeter Trust in Dunwoody,
We have the details of the route because someone at the depot has a nasal problem.
The bank itself is right near the Buford Highway, so we should be able to hit the ramp within 60 seconds of getting out.
We also have a diversion crew.
They're gonna blow up a bread truck a ways away, keep the fuzz busy.
The dress code is the Michael
Myers Halloween mask, but don't all buy your masks at the same time. It looks suspicious.
The switch car is ready, but you want me to hit the long-stay parking structure at Hartsfield-Jackson to get a heist vehicle that stays colder longer.
Boost a commuter car, a family car, something that blends in well with morning traffic.
Something on the heavy side in case we need to ram the cops off the road.
A Escalade, Yukon,
Avalanche, whatever.
It needs to be ready for an 8:30 start in the a.m.
Questions?
Well, ain't y'all cute.
That's my Baby.
Fuck your Baby.
What's in there is ours.
It belongs to us.
They took our money, our hard-earned paper.
They snuck in when we were asleep last night and took the pants off the chair and emptied our wallets.
They got what's rightfully ours.
Let's go get it back, what's rightfully ours.
What the fuck is this mask?
Austin Powers.
Doc said Michael Myers!
This is Mike Myers!
It should be the Halloween mask.
This is a Halloween mask!
No, the killer dude from Halloween.
Oh, you mean Jason.
No!
No! God! Fuck!
Let's go.
Wait, wait.
I got to start the song over.
The fuck?
What?
Okay, go.
Move!
Go! âª I be a doll, be a baby doll âª It can't be fun, not anyway âª It can't be found
No way at all âª A distant man can't sympathize âª He can't uphold his distant laws âª Due to form on that today... âª
Go!
Yeah, we out! Let's go!
Let's move!
I got this.
Come on! Let's go!
Man up!
It's a tough business.
Go! Hit it!
Yeah, Baby!
Look out! Fuck!
What the fuck?
We got a hero!
Go! âª No more sight to bring you down... âª
God damn!
Fuck! Get him!
Do your job, Baby.
Let's go!
Shit!
Watch out, watch out, watch out!
Yeah!
That's how you do it, Baby!
Come on!
Yes!
Ha!
What the fuck?
Soldier Boy.
He ain't giving up, huh? âª I be a man, kinda mystery man... âª
Come on, Soldier Boy.
Shit!
Ah! No, no, no, no! No!
No!
No!
Got your ass now. âª She can't afford no gun at all...
Damn it! I had that G.I. Joe motherfucker dead to rights!
God damn!
New ride. Let's go.
Come on, boys, let's rock!
Move! Move! Move! Move!
Huh? Sweetheart.
Oh, my love.
Get out the car!
I have a child!
I got one, too.
Get the fuck out!
No!
Come on!
Get in! Let's move.
Here, it's okay.
Bring your sorry ass over!
God damn it! Shit!
Baby, what are you doing?
Here, take him.
Leave the baby in the car.
Leave the baby in the car!
Get your damn weird ass over here now!
Come on! Let's go!
I'm coming! âª Be a doll, be a baby doll... âª
Let's rock!
Let's go!
Oh, shit! No! Fuck!
I left my shotgun behind.
What?
I left my shotgun behind.
Not groovy, JD.
Not groovy at all.
Cops! Cops! Cops!
Shit. Get down.
Stay down. Stay down. âª Neat neat neat âª She ain't got no name to call Neat neat neat âª She can't afford no cannon âª Neat neat neat âª
All units be on the lookout for a red Saturn Aura, license plate...
You see JD over there?
Now, JD's a idiot.
But you a bright boy, though.
So I got a question for you.
You make me miss that shot?
Come on, now.
You can tell me.
No.
You're a good driver.
You're a bad liar, though.
In this business, the moment you catch feelings...
Is the moment you catch a bullet.
Now, pick up your purse and go get the coffee. âª Come on, everybody âª Hey! âª Ugh, all right, hit it âª You move to the left âª Then you go for yourself âª You move to the right...
About goddamn time. âª If it takes all night âª Oh, come on, baby... âª
Oh, you looking for JD?
International Man of Mystery?
'Cause he's long gone, Baby.
You got that right.
Just put it down.
We'll drink it.
So, this is it.
I'm a man of my word.
And you're all straight,
Baby.
That's it?
Sure is.
You're all paid up. Cause for celebration.
Yeah, sure is.
Oh.
Yeah, well, before you go completely crazy...
You need to sunset that ride.
Drive safe, Baby. âª Know it sounds funny, but I just can't stand the pain âª Girl,
I'm leaving you tomorrow âª Seems to me, girl, you know I've done all I can âª You see I begged, stole and I borrowed âª Yeah âª Ooh, that's why I'm easy âª Ah, ah, ah, ah âª I'm easy like Sunday morning âª Ah, ah, ah, ah âª
You're back.
I sure am.
Well, then, you, sir, are gonna be my very last customer, because I am walking out that door in precisely 30 seconds.
You're leaving?
Yes, sir.
Can I come with you?
You don't have work or nothing?
Uh, I don't.
I am done with work.
Wow. You seem real happy about that.
Yeah, I sure am.
God damn it!
I don't blame you. Well, you're welcome to come with, but I don't know how exciting you're gonna find the laundromat.
Huh?
I got to run some errands.
Oh.
But think about what you want, and I will stick around just for you.
Coffee?
Please. Uh, cream and sugar.
So, how you two getting along?
Oh, good.
He's sweet, isn't he?
That kid? He's been coming here since before me.
Think maybe his mom used to work here.
Huh.
Know what you want?
Your name?
Well, you can get that for free.
It's Debbie. Debora.
Oh, like the song.
The Beck one? Yeah.
Well, except I'm D-E-B-O-R-A, and I think that's just D-E-B-R-A.
I don't know that one.
Oh, it goes, um... âª I met you at JCPenney âª I think your nametag said Jenny âª
Jenny?
The song's about him wanting to get with Jenny and her sister, too, whose name is Debra.
So it's not even really about me.
It's about the sister.
My sister's name is Mary.
She has got all the songs.
"Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?"
"Proud Mary keep on burnin'."
"The Wind Cries Mary."
She's got me beat. Again.
She's got endless songs.
I got one.
No, you got two.
What's the other one?
Debora, the song I'm talking about.
Who by?
Trex.
T.Rex?
Uh, yeah.
I've heard of them, but don't know that one.
How's it go?
Oh. âª Oh, oh, Debora âª Always look like a zeb-ora âª
"A zeb-ora"?
Like a zebra, I guess.
Yeah. Well, I'm wearing black and white, so you can call me Deebra.
Actually, I actually got Debora on here.
Okay, what? How many of those do you have?
Oh, I got different iPods for different days and moods.
Oh. And you're in a pink and glittery mood.
I am now.
What is your name?
Baby.
Wait, what?
Your name's Baby?
B-A-B-Y, Baby?
Yeah.
Well, then, you have us all beat.
Every damn song is about you.
We could drive back and forth across the States forever and never run out of "Baby" songs.
We might run out of gas, though.
Did your mom call you "Baby" as a kid?
Sometimes.
She used to work here?
Sometimes, but, uh, she was a singer, too.
What does she do now?
Nothing.
Uh, I could find
Debora if you want.
Debbie!
For crying out loud.
Well, uh, play it for me sometime
I don't have to get out of here.
Deal?
Yeah, deal.
Now, you know what you want yet?
To get out of here. âª Dug-a-re-dug, dug-a-re-dug-a-da âª Dug-a-re-dug, dug-a-re-dug-a-da âª Dug-a-re-dug, dug-a-re-dug-a-da âª Dug-a-re-dug, dug-a-re-dug âª Oh, Debora, always look like a zeb-ora âª Your sunken face... âª
You're right. I do like it.
Good.
So, what's your story, Baby?
You from here?
I am.
Keep going. Keep going.
You're from here.
Uh-huh.
You're a driver. You like music.
You don't talk much.
No.
I've, uh, spoken more to you today than I have to anyone all year.
Whoa.
Okay.
Not a motor-mouth. Noted.
Yeah, yeah. I have...
I have this, uh, hearing thing.
I was in an accident when I was little.
Is that what happened to your mom?
Yeah. Yeah, and my dad.
I miss her.
I'm sorry.
No, don't be.
I live with my foster dad, but now he's getting old, so it's more like
I'm looking after him.
Yeah. I know how that feels.
I had to look after my mom when she got sick.
It might seem tough now, but once they're gone, you'll miss having someone to care for.
I don't have much to keep me here anymore.
You don't?
You know, mmm, we could get together some other time, some other place?
Oh, you mean, uh, somewhere that's not a diner or a laundromat?
Yeah, well, it's not that this isn't nice but...
Oh, well, we could go to, uh... Um...
Oh, Bacchanalia.
I've never been.
I... I hear it's nice.
Oh, it's... It's the finest winin' and dinin' of all the wines and dines in town.
That is nice.
Um, but they got me pulling doubles this week, though.
What about next week?
What's your schedule like?
I don't know.
Oh, I forgot.
They call, you go.
No, I mean, I'm...
I'm not working.
You're not driving anymore?
No.
I'm sorry.
No, don't be.
It's my choice.
Well, aren't you the lucky one. âª I want to get with you âª Only you, girl âª And your sister âª I think her name's Debra âª Oh, oh... âª
So who's Debora?
The girl.
His name,
Malik Kelly, a local veteran.
You saw what these folks were doing.
You took action. Why?
I'm done.
I saw these guys go marching in the bank with Halloween masks, weapons drawn.
They were attacking...
Is this the place?
Here.
Pizza?
Are we celebrating?
Celebrating you getting a real job.
What kind of job?
Wouldn't it be good to bring joy to people when you drive?
Pizza?
Order's up!
Whoa.
That was fast.
I know.
Pizza!
Look...
You only have to wash your hands once after counting that.
I know.
And not put other lives in danger.
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I'm not talking about me. âª Baby, let me take you âª Let me take you in my arms âª Let me take you in my arms and hold you âª Show you I love you âª Baby, I love you âª Baby, I love you âª Baby, baby, I love you âª Don't love nobody else âª You got my love just for yourself... âª
You're all good. A gentleman picked this up already.
A gentleman?
Who is that?
It's my old boss.
Uh...
Excuse me one second.
Here you are, madam.
Thank you very much.
Have a good night.
Good meal, Baby?
That foie gras terrine is something, huh?
Yeah.
You don't look happy to see me. Why?
I said we were straight, but did you think we were done?
That that was it?
Uh, I guess I did.
Well, I could give you the good news and the bad news, except there is no bad news.
The good news is you're about to make a lot of money.
And the good news is you're about to make a lot of money.
I got... I got a job, Doc.
Yeah, but why slave away delivering GoodFellas pizzas just to afford a night out here, when you could make all that dough with a great fella? Me.
And then take your gal here for fucking dinner every night of the week?
You paid off your debt.
Now it's time to profit.
This is the fun bit, Baby.
By the time this job is over, you'll be rolling in money, buying Maseratis and feeding your gal catfish dipped in gold.
So, what do you say?
You in?
Am I in?
No, don't answer my question with another question.
You give me one of two replies. Yes or no.
No, Doc.
You know I never do a job with the exact same crew twice, right?
Yes.
And you also know you've been my driver for every job since we met.
Yes.
So, I'm of the thinking that you are my lucky charm and that I'm not doing this job without you.
Now, I don't think I need to give you the speech about what happens when you say no, how I could break your legs and kill everyone you love, because you already know that, don't you?
Yeah.
So, what's it gonna be, behind the wheel or in a wheelchair?
The first one.
I'll pick you up in the morning.
Don't stay out too late, now.
Oh.
And your, uh, waitress girlfriend, she's cute.
Let's keep it that way.
Good night, sir.
Well, that was some pretty fine winin' and dinin'.
Must have friends in high places to get a table there.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Is everything okay, Baby?
It will be.
You want to talk about it?
I make a mean cup of coffee.
I mean, I... I don't.
I make terrible coffee.
I want to, but I...
I can't right now.
You know, you...
You don't have to worry about me.
You can tell me anything.
I'm not worried about you.
I mean, I...
You're the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
And I just worry that
I'm not good enough for you.
Oh, well, don't.
I can see you're kind and you're different.
And I'm here for you when you're ready.
What are you doing tomorrow?
Uh, you tell me.
Good morning.
These places never get rolled.
People don't realize that there's gold in them there hills.
And those that do, don't have the stones to pull off a job so public in the hub of it.
This place'll be ripe around this time tomorrow, but I need you to do something for me today.
I can't be seen in there, but you can.
So go inside.
Take note of the number of cameras and positions, the number of registers open, the number of employees and the number of customers.
Is there a guard?
Is he armed?
Do they have bandit glass?
And get in line, buy some stamps.
Take your buds out, pull your shades off.
Oh, and, uh, take the nephew.
Less suspicious.
The United States Postal Service.
We're here, working for you, seven days a week.
We do a lot more than just stamps these days.
You'd be surprised at what we have to offer.
Yeah, Jack, all looks fine back here. Over.
No bandit glass, one armed guard,
10 cameras, eight registers, two open,
11 customers and four employees.
Thank you.
Uh...
Uh, stamps.
That your boy?
Sure.
Yeah, he sure is.
How old is he?
Four.
Eight.
They grow up so freaking fast, don't they?
Does he have a name?
You have a name, don't you?
Samm.
Well, Samm, I got a mint with your name on it.
You have a mint that says "Samm"?
Aw.
Sweet.
Are you here tomorrow?
Sure am. Working 9:00 to 5:00, just like Dolly.
Oh, Dolly Parton. Yeah.
I like her.
Mmm, who doesn't?
"Everybody wants happiness, nobody wants pain.
"But you can't have a rainbow without a little rain."
Wise lady.
Yeah, she sure is.
Hmm.
Bye.
Hit me.
No bandit glass, one armed guard,
10 cameras, eight registers, three open.
And, uh, 11 customers.
And, uh, four employees.
Anything else?
The teller seemed nice.
She gave me a mint.
Did she?
Yeah.
You probably wouldn't even need to use a gun with her.
Just say "boo," and she'll give you the big bills first.
Chip's off the old block.
What floor are you on?
Third.
Those stairs must be a real bitch for Joe, huh?
It's my business to know everything.
So, are they a bitch?
There's an elevator.
Ooh, fancy.
So, am I gonna see you tonight?
Yes, you will.
You're not just saying what you think I want to hear, right?
You consider me a friend, don't you?
You and I are a team.
Nothing is more important than our friendship.
Good to know.
You'll be out of this shithole soon.
You're going up in the world!
Bo's Diner, what'll you have?
Is Debora there?
Debbie, phone.
Keep it short.
Hello?
It's Baby.
Hey. To what do
I owe this honor?
I just wanted to hear your voice.
Am I still seeing you later?
I have to drive again.
Oh, okay. Thought y'all were done with that.
So did I.
It's not what I want.
And what do you want, Baby?
I want us to head west on 20, in a car we can't afford, with a plan we don't have.
Keep driving and never stop.
Are you serious?
I am, Debora.
You in?
I'm in, Baby.
See you soon. âª Holy calamity, scream insanity âª All you ever gonna be's another great fan of me âª Break âª Bear witness âª Bear witness, bear witness âª
There he is.
Hey, Baby.
Hey, Baby.
Hear-No-Evil's back, huh?
Have you seen this kid move?
Yeah, I've seen him.
Think Doc likes having him around because he can park in the disabled spots by the bank.
Disabled spot?
Yeah.
He got some shit wrong with his ears.
Tinnitus or something.
Anyway, he gotta listen to music 24 hours a day to drown out the whining in his ears.
Oh, shit!
You know who else has the exact same thing and does that exact same thing?
Barbra Streisand.
Darling, do I look like
I know a fucking thing about Barbra fucking Streisand?
Hey! Watch your mouth.
That's my lady you're talking to.
Yeah.
Watch your mouth.
I'll watch what
I want to watch.
Is that true?
Is that why you have music in your head all the time?
Drown out the noise?
Yeah.
It keeps me moving.
It's an escape. I get it.
Hey, Buddy, you seen a violin?
I had a violin here.
Shut up.
I used to fool around with cars when I was a kid.
Drive around all night like a speed freak listening to the radio.
I used to have my special tape that had my killer track on it. Get me flying.
You got one of those?
Sure.
Well, what is it?
Brighton Rock.
What?
Queen?
Yeah.
It's got that crazy big guitar solo.
Yeah, I know that song.
My brother used to play Sheer Heart Attack right through the wall.
You got it on here?
Uh, I got it on this one.
Play it.
Let's hear that killer track.
Yeah.
What you ladies listening to?
Queen.
Queen!
Queen? Streisand, now Queen.
What the fuck? What y'all gonna do?
Y'all gonna belt out show tunes on the way to the job?
You don't need a score for a score.
You just...
Put your fucking foot on the gas and drive the goddamn car.
That's all the music you need, folks.
Come on, now.
You never been a wheelman?
You never had a lucky song?
Well, a cigarette song.
Apres-heist, glass of scotch.
Absolutely.
But not before a job.
I got enough demons right here playing music all the time.
Yeah, well, that I believe.
Had a buddy once walk away from a job.
You know why?
Because something was playing on the radio he didn't like.
We about to go in, he won't get out the fucking car. Why?
'Cause Knock, Knock,
Knockin' on Heaven's Door is playing on the FM.
He called it a hex song.
That, End of the Road by Boyz II Men,
Hotel California by the Eagles.
He called 'em all hex songs.
Then come talking about some crazy shit like we all gonna die.
So what?
You bail on the job?
Fuck no,
I didn't bail on the job.
I went and got that money.
And we didn't die, either.
Now, he bought it a little later, but it had nothing to do with the heist.
Do all your stories end up with somebody dying?
I guess you just got to find out, huh?
I need four pairs of eyes and three sets of ears.
Gather round.
The postal service is dying.
People don't care about their mail anymore.
Lucky for us, their loss is our gain.
Money orders.
For I happen to know a guy who has a machine that can turn blank ones into green.
Each box contains
250 slips per box, each slip worth up to a grand.
That's quarter a mil per box.
Dot, dot, dot.
You do the math.
Darling goes in the front.
Buddy takes a five-alligator count and follows her inside.
You put on these privacy glasses to blind the CCTV camera.
Another five-alligator count.
Darling gets in line,
Buddy takes her hostage, shotgun to her head.
That gets you guys in the back office.
We role-play that a lot.
Uh-huh.
Baby drives Bats around the loading dock.
Bats uses this security card supplied by an insider with a nasal problem to get in the staff entrance and cover the rear.
You guys grab all the boxes and then sneak out the back to Baby and the waiting car.
Did you get all that, Baby?
Yeah.
Okay, one more thing.
We need some fresh hardware, not traceable to us or any previous jobs.
Now, I've got some contacts who can get us some clean firepower, so the pickup is tonight.
But after the pickup, you come straight back here.
You all have an early start in the morning, and there's eyes everywhere.
So, you're staying the night here.
Oh, we in bed together now. âª Nowhere to run to, baby âª Nowhere to hide âª Got nowhere to run to, baby âª Nowhere to hide âª It's not love
I'm a-running from... âª
Pull over there.
I got to take a leak.
Want some gum?
Want some gum, Buddy?
Yeah, I'll take some gum.
Tell me what we're gonna do with all that money.
We're gonna go to Vegas.
We'll put it all on red.
We'll get married again.
It'll be real romantic.
Mmm.
You know what was real, real romantic?
What was real, real romantic?
When you stabbed that guy.
Which guy?
The guy that robbed you, the guy that called you a whore, or the guy that looked at you funny?
The last one.
Yeah. I do remember that.
Bats just looked at me funny.
You want me to kill Bats?
Not before the job, silly.
Hmm?
You think we should talk about this in front of Baby?
He won't say a thing.
Will you, Baby? Hmm?
Jesus Christ.
What, did you steal all this?
You said you wanted some gum.
Fuck I'm supposed to do, pay for it?
Let's go.
Let's go. âª I can't around it, no âª Nowhere to run âª Nowhere to hide from you, baby... âª
Looks like the farmers' market is open.
Farmers' market?
Yeah. Doc says we got to go see The Butcher.
Come on, you're going in with us.
We might not be leaving in this.
And, uh, find something funky on there.
Just in case we got to rip this joint up.
Take this.
Act like you know how to use it.
Why would he need it?
Got to swagger in like you got one, so we don't all look like a bunch of pussies.
Darling excluded.
What's with the earbuds?
Recording this or something?
It's just his music.
Yeah, he's loony.
He's just like his tunes.
What's he listening to?
How the fuck I know?
Let me check.
Tequila!
Which reminds me, why'd the Mexican dude throw his wife off the cliff?
Ah! Ruined it.
Didn't I ruin it?
We met before, right?
I don't know.
You still alive, right?
Uh-huh.
Then I guess we ain't never met.
Shut the fuck up!
I've got it.
I've got it.
Voila!
Welcome to la charcuterie.
Tonight, gentlemen, madame, we have only the finest cuts of pork, direct from the local smokehouse.
You're all experienced butchers yourself.
I assume you are aware that the humble pig can be cooked from nose to tail, everything but the squeal.
I can offer you nine cuts at the best prices in all of Christendom.
So let's dive in head-first.
From the jowl comes the godsent
Roman bacon that is guanciale.
From the shoulder of the hog comes the Boston butt, a tough but tasty cut.
The picnic shoulder is a favorite of those who enjoy the smoking of pigs.
The center-cut loin, the double-cut pork chops, baby back ribs, and the Serrano ham, on the back leg, of course.
All delicious.
Delicious.
And, of course, we have a fine selection of sausages.
Well, I'm hungry.
Fantastique.
And your choice is...
Well, I'm gonna go with the picnic shoulder,
'cause, um, I just love smoking pigs.
Done deal.
Dumb son of a bitch.
Whoa! Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Fuck, Bats!
You got my wife shot!
I don't like that!
Relax, Buddy.
You handled it!
What the fuck, you piece of shit?
You shot the gunsmiths.
Weren't they fucking Doc's contacts?
They were Doc's contacts!
Guess what, they was pigs.
Look at the box.
It says "APD."
I clocked that tall strip of bacon with that fake-ass Louis
Vuitton hat right off the bat.
He busted me in '98.
Now, I don't know about you lovebirds fucking without a condom, but when somebody getting ready to barbecue me,
I go full-metal batshit on...
Shit!
Get him!
Baby, don't let him get away!
Get him! Get him!
Do something!
Get him!
Oh, shit! âª Tequila... âª
Get us out of here, Baby.
Let's move.
Come on, let's go. Move. âª Tequila âª
âª Run, run, run...
âª Whoo! âª
Bats, you are fucking crazy.
When your folks name you Bats, you gonna end up crazy.
I don't doubt you're crazy, but your real name is not Bats.
So says you.
You think my real name's Darling?
Yeah, or Buddy?
No, they're nicknames.
Code names, monikers.
So, what's your real name, Darling?
Monica.
Hey, I thought we weren't allowed to discuss names.
We're not.
Baby, what's your real name?
Huh?
Hey, stop, stop, stop up here.
Stop up here.
I said stop. I'm hungry.
No.
Stop the car!
No?
You're telling me no?
I don't want to go in there.
"I don't want to go in there."
Well, hello, Baby.
Bodies hit the floor back there, you don't say shit.
Now all of a sudden, you getting...
You getting riled up about stopping at a diner?
I don't want to go in there.
It sucks.
Well, with that recommendation, we gots to go in now. âª When something is wrong âª With my baby âª Something is wrong with me... âª
Now, why y'all so mad?
You should be thanking ol' Bats.
For being a walking fucking death wish?
Well, I treat all of my jobs like it's my last.
Yeah, but what you do within this group affects all of us.
Fine, cowboy. You're gonna get your money tomorrow. Plus, uh...
I know you guys got noses to feed.
What, yeah, like you're Mr. Clean.
I'm Mr. Whatever the Fuck I Wanna Be.
Can I get you anything to drink?
Uh, yeah, I think it'll be, uh, Coke all around, right?
How... How you say it in your language? Coca?
So let me get three
Cokes and one Coca.
Four Cokes?
Yeah.
Look, here's the deal.
You rob to support a drug habit.
I do drugs to support a robbery habit.
That's clever.
That's my job, see.
It's you two who's on vacation.
So you doubt our credentials?
Wall Street, right?
Doc tell you that?
Doc ain't tell me shit.
Just a educated guess from an uneducated man.
Well, Bats, I would be fascinated to hear your thoughts on the matter.
Tell me if I'm way off,
Buddy.
You were a stockbroker.
Maybe a different wife, maybe kids.
You stack your paper, but you say shit like,
"Work hard, play harder," but you play a little too hard.
You rack up debt, the type of debt that'd make a white man blush.
Maybe you get into a little trouble.
Maybe you get your hand caught in the corporate cookie jar.
Maybe you leave and run off to the desert.
Maybe with your favorite lap dancer in tow.
Maybe you disappear into a world consisting of three things, money, sex, drugs and action.
Oh, shit, that's four.
Am I close?
This how I look at it.
You guys just think this is a trip.
Either way, if you are Wall Street, you're a bigger fucking crook than I could ever be.
I'm gonna go right ahead and speak for the two of us.
You think you know us?
You don't.
Mmm.
You think you're the last word in crazy?
You're not.
And believe me when I tell you, you don't want to see my Buddy mad.
You haven't seen how relentless he is.
Because when he sees red, you will see nothing but black.
You hear that, Speedy?
That's some Oscar shit right there.
That was nice.
Did you rehearse that?
You see this shit, Baby?
See, now this is a prime example of a man who loves a woman.
You guys are perfect for each other.
I mean that.
Well, what can I get you to eat?
Get these cats some Happy Meals, and, uh, I'm gonna take care of the bill, uh, "Debora."
Yo, my friend here, he, uh...
He doesn't like this place, but I think this place kind of nice, you know?
So let me ask you something,
Debora. âª Every little bit hurts... âª
What's his problem?
Uh, maybe your friend would like to fill out a suggestion slip.
Tell us how to improve our service. âª Why you treat me cold âª Yet you won't let me go... âª
Baby, you know that bitch?
No.
Okay.
Let's bounce.
I got this.
What the fuck is your problem?
Hmm? âª My love is strong for you âª I'd do wrong for you...
Okay.
Well, make sure you tip the nice lady. âª I can't go on âª Giving my life away âª Oh, come back to me âª Darling, you'll see âª I can give you all the things âª That you wanted before âª If you will stay with me âª Yeah âª Every little bit hurts âª Every little bit hurts âª
Bananas.
"Bananas" is a code word.
Whenever a deal is done with one of my clients, they call me on the phone and they say the word "bananas," and then they hang up.
I did not hear the word "bananas" tonight.
So you tell me who died.
Well, your contacts was cops, Doc.
I know. They were my cops.
Yeah, well, they fired first.
And I'm not gonna take a bullet for you or nobody else in this motherfucker.
Is that true?
They fired first?
Yeah.
Baby?
Ask somebody on the planet Earth.
I will ask whoever the fuck I want.
Go home, job's off.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
No. What the fuck?
We are 24 hours from being descended upon by this entire city.
Those pigs are in hog heaven.
The only way they can ID us is with a Ouija board or some shit.
Well, your name only takes four letters to spell out.
Doc, Bats ain't my real fucking name.
It's over, Leon.
Get out of town.
Wow.
Well, I ain't running, Doc.
I say we drive into the storm.
Ride the hurricane.
We could be on a non-extradition beach, drinking non-extradition cocktails, counting our non-extradition cash in 23 hours.
And who do we get to fence those money orders since you shot the fence?
Buddy got a guy.
I mean, I'm just taking a wild guess here, but Buddy got a guy.
Ain't that right,
Wall Street?
Yeah, I got a guy.
So let's fucking do this.
I only hear three voices, and the last time I checked, there's four in a car.
Baby? Your call.
Time to make a big-boy decision.
Do we do this thing or not?
He's outvoted.
We doing it.
Let him speak.
I say we all get some sleep.
Get ready for this fucking thing.
Baby? Your call.
Time to make a big-boy decision.
Do we do this thing or not?
Do we do this thing or not?
Do we do this thing or not?
Do we do this thing or not?
Do we do this thing or not? âª B-A-B-Y âª Oh, baby âª B-A-B-Y âª Baby âª
Where you going, Baby?
Uh, coffee.
At 2:00 a.m.?
That doesn't sound smart.
You fucking kidding me?
I got enough on my plate, worrying about Bats, I got to worry about you, too, now?
You know what?
Do me a favor.
If you're gonna mail it in at the post office tomorrow, then go on your little caffeine run and don't come back.
If you're just in this for the buzz, if driving is just some kind of escape for you, then go.
What y'all doing in here? Huh?
Just making sure everything's ready for tomorrow.
Oh, yeah.
Well, uh, look like he's going somewhere at 2:00 in the morning.
Are you?
No.
Good. That's good.
'Cause we got to discuss this.
No, no, it's the same one.
Baby? Your call.
Time to make a big-boy decision.
Do we do this thing or not?
Now, why you want to go and do that?
It's just me fooling around.
I like to record stuff.
Why you like to record stuff?
You the police?
Supposed to squeal on the road, not to the cops.
Speak up, Baby.
I... I like to listen back to conversations.
I make music out of the words, songs, mixes. It's just something I do.
That's one fucking dumbass excuse.
To be fair, even the cops couldn't come up with an excuse that fucking dumbass.
Now can you play us one of your mixes?
I can't, they're... They're just...
They're at home.
Well, it looks like we're all going somewhere at 2:00 in the morning, then.
Come on.
I live really far away.
No, you don't.
Wake up, Baby.
Time to explain.
Joe.
Where is he?
What did you do to him?
Oh, the cripple?
Oh, don't worry about him.
He's good.
He ain't going nowhere.
Why don't you play us something, Baby? âª Was... Was he slow? âª No... N-no âª Good... Good kid âª And a devil-devil-devil behind the wheel âª Was he slow? âª "Retarded" means slow
Was he slow? âª No... N-no âª Then... Then what the hell âª Else more do you need to know? âª
This shit is bananas, Doc.
B-A-N-A-N-A-S.
Hello? Hello, testing.
It's Debbie. Debora.
Yeah, except I'm D-E-B-O-R-A.
"Debora." Isn't that the waitress from the diner?
You said you didn't know that bitch.
Why would you say you didn't know her?
Have you been talking to Debora about us?
I don't say nothing.
What about Wheels?
He can't say nothing.
Yeah, but he can read motherfucking lips, though, can't he?
Take this fool back to his shithole.
I'll find another driver for tomorrow.
Doc, I'm available. I can take him where he needs to go, get him home safe.
No, you're not getting a new driver.
I've been on every job since we met.
I don't squeal to the cops,
I squeal on the road.
And I'm not slow, I'm fast.
I'm your driver tomorrow.
I'm driving.
Well, you heard the kid.
He's driving.
I'll tell him.
The Atlanta region is under a light, scattered thunderstorm advisory through 4:00 p.m. this afternoon, with sunny skies expected to show up around...
In downtown Atlanta today due to the ongoing construction work at the intersection of Ted Turner and...
Chance of scattered thunderstorms throughout most of the day.
Low tonight about 40.
Tomorrow mostly sunny, 66.
Remember, what's in there is ours.
Belongs to us.
They got our money.
They got our mama's jewels.
So let's go back in there and take back what's ours.
Vroom, vroom, vroom.
It's go time, Baby.
How the fuck I look?
Mmm-mmm.
Drop it!
Okay, Baby, let's go.

Go, go, go, go!
Hey!
Stop, or we'll shoot!
Hey! You can't...
Freeze!
Stop right there!
Hey! Whoa! What?
The driver of the car has escaped on foot.
So Laura said...
...dangerous.
No fucking way!
Baby, you are a fucking jinx!
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
Fuck!
Just go!
Baby, fucking get us out of here!
This is your mess!
Your fault!
Put down your weapon!
Get down!
Pull back!
Get an EMT here now!
Drop your weapon! Now!
This is all your fault.
Put your hands where I can see 'em!
Fuck!
Got three officers hit!
Suspect on foot!
You! Stop!
We need support over here. âª I woke up again this morning âª I'm so tired of giving up and running... âª
Get out of the car.
No.
Get out of the car, lady.
Yes. Yeah.
Getting out.
Getting out of the car.
I'm getting... Oh, my God!
Oh, my purse!
Shootout near Peachtree Center.
Botched post office robbery. âª Don't need no phone at all âª We've got a thing âª That's called radar love âª We've got a wave in the air âª
I'm sorry, ma'am.
God.
What the fuck?
I have breaking news.
This is coming to you live from the scene of a police shootout in downtown Atlanta.
Police tell us that three robbers entered a US Post Office branch downtown shortly after 1:00 p.m.
But what started as a robbery...
Shit. Oh, shit, Joe!
Joe, Joe, Joe!
You all right?
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.
All right. We got to get out of here.
All right? Things are bad.
I'm not blind!
No.
No. No.
I don't want your dirty money!
I know, I know, but I can't leave you here!
From the scene of that shooting, and we want to warn you that some of that video is very graphic...
Bo's Diner. What'll you have?
Is Debora there?
Debbie?
She's with a customer right now.
You want to hold?
Just tell her Baby's coming.
Baby?
B-A-B-Y. Baby.
Be on the lookout for a 1986 purple Chevy Caprice.
The whereabouts of these felons are unknown.
Four policemen were wounded in a downtown shootout.
Police say not to approach under any circumstances.
Still at large, are considered extremely dangerous.
Hello.
My name is Joseph.
Uh, I like TV.
And I also like to listen, sometimes, to old records through the vibrations.
I like frozen peas and meatloaf and white bread and peanut butter.
Spread to the edges.
Please look after me.
Thank you.
Will you come back?
I don't know.
Is everything going to be OK?
I promised nothing would happen to you.
And I failed.
But you're safe now.
I'm not talking about me.
This is the Atlanta Police Department.
All residents, remain inside your homes.
There is an armed and dangerous criminal on the loose.
Good luck.
Do not go outside until an all-clear is given.
Your buddy's here. âª Ah âª Oh, baby... âª
Hey, lovebirds.
I was hoping
I would catch you two.
And here you are.
Police have identified three of the four robbers.
Killed were Monica Castello
and Leon Jefferson III.
Monica.
My darling.
She was a good girl.
I love...
I loved her. âª Right on âª Keep on doing it...
What about Debora, Baby?
Is she...
Is she a good girl?
You love her?
Yes, I do. âª I swear you got it...
That's too bad. âª Keep on, keep on

Song is over, Baby.
But I'm afraid you still have to face the music.
How you two doing tonight?
We're doing just fine.
Ain't that right, Baby?
Oh, God damn it!
Oh, my gosh!
Come on.
Jesus Christ, man!
Come on. Let's go. Come on!
You can't keep running, Baby!
There's no escape!
Come on! Let's get out of here!
Okay. Okay.
I will find you!
Oh, fuck.
Oh...
Fuck!
What's happening, Baby?
I have to go.
No. I'm coming with you.
He just shot a guy!
Who?
Him!
Atlanta Police Department!
You on the ground, are you okay?
Can you show me where you've been shot?
Yeah.
Right there.
Officer down.
Shots fired.
I repeat, shots fired at Bo's Diner.
Unit 412 currently on scene, requesting backup.
Possible female hostage.
All units in the vicinity respond immediately...
Who's this?
It's Baby.
Like I said, who's this?
I need your help.
I'm afraid this line is dead.
Baby, we need to get out of here.
I just need one thing first.
And then it's just us, music and the road.
But we don't have a car.
Or music.
Yeah, we do.
Get out.
Check out
Bonnie and Clyde, yo.
More like
Bonnie and Bonnie.
Get out of the car.
You holding?
You ever shot a gun before, homie?
I just did.
Literally five minutes ago.
Can I at least get my goddamn phone?
No. âª Some of the busiest rhymes ever made by man âª Are goin' into this mic
Written by this hand âª Are comin' out of this mouth
Made by this tongue âª I'll tell you now, my name
My name is Young âª But so you think that it's your destiny to get the best of me âª But I suggest to be quiet, bro Don't even try it... âª Groovin' it and always movin' it 'Cause I'm not fakin' it âª Pullin' out rhymes like books off the shelf âª Born in England, raised in
Hollis Taught to go for myself âª This is stone cold rhymin'
No frills, no fluffs âª And it's no accident that these rhymes sound tough âª I'm goin' off, baby, there's no turnin' back âª I'm on your TV, on your album, cassette and 8-track âª And when the show is finally finished I'll be takin' my bow âª My name is Young
And, yo, I got know-how âª
Not a chauffeur. Noted.
It's over, kid.
I ain't open.
I need those tapes.
I'm not giving you those tapes.
I have the money orders.
I'll trade you for one of those tapes.
I can't help you, Baby.
I shot Buddy.
Congratulations.
Then you only have every clean and dirty cop after you.
You gonna shoot me, too?
Never.
You and I are a team. I...
Don't feed me any more lines from Monsters, Inc.
It pisses me off.
It's one of
Samm's favorites.
I thought it sounded familiar, you little shit.
I'm not your lucky charm anymore.
But I'm standing here asking for your help.
There's nothing
I can do for you, kid.
Why should I, after what you've done to me?
It's okay. Let's go.
Oh, God damn it.
Look at the two of you.
Okay, go get your fucking tape.
It's going to take more than a cassette to get you two out of this, because the news is all bad.
Well, there is some good news.
The good news is you like driving, because you can't take your foot off the gas for the next 25 years.
This should be enough to get you across the border.
From there, it's on you.
Don't trust anyone but each other, and don't ever look back.
I was in love once.
Bananas.
Run.
I thought...
I thought I told you to run.
Go. I'll deal with the cops.
That's not the cops.
Here it is, Baby.
Your killer track.
Oh, fuck. âª Happy little day Jimmy went away âª Met his little... âª
Move! âª Jenny, will you stay?
Tarry with me pray âª Nothing 'ere need come between us âª Tell me, love, what do you say? âª Oh, no, I must away to my mum in disarray âª If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday âª It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air âª
The bag! Get the bag!
Okay.
Fuck!
We're getting out.
We're getting out?
I have to end this.
Come on out now, Baby.
"Romeo, Romeo!
"Wherefore art thou Romeo?"
Now!
Motherfucker!
Be on the lookout for squad car 3204, believed to be stolen by a Jason Van Horn.
Show yourself, Baby!
You fucking child!
Hey, you okay, buddy?
He is armed and extremely dangerous.
Fuck! Jesus!
He shot me!
Assistance!
Assistance, please! âª Jenny pines away
Writes a letter every day âª We must ever be together
Nothing can my love erase âª Oh, no, I'm compromised
I must apologize âª If my lady should discover how I spent my holidays âª
Fuck you, Buddy.
Shit, shit, shit!
Baby!
You did good, kid.
But you took something away from me that I love.
You know
I got to do the same.
I really wish you could hear her scream.
Guess you'll just have to watch.
Baby.
What are you doing?
Hitting the road.
Listening to music.
Is this really your mom?
Yeah.
She has a beautiful voice.
I know. âª That's why I'm easy âª I'm easy like Sunday morning âª That's why I'm easy âª I'm easy like Sunday morning âª Why in the world would anybody âª Put chains on me... âª
This is an active scene.
Hold all positions. âª I've paid my dues to make it âª Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be âª I'm not happy when I try to fake it âª Oh âª That's why I'm easy âª Ah, ah, ah, ah âª I'm easy like Sunday morning... âª
You don't belong in this world.
No. âª Easy âª I'm easy like Sunday morning âª I wanna be high âª So high âª I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
Hands behind your back! âª I wanna be free âª
Do not move!            -I'm sorry.
Please, leave him alone!
How would you describe your relationship with the defendant?
We were friends.
And I think we both wanted to be more than that.
He got himself into a bad spot.
I was just trying to get him out.
I believe the defendant is of good character.
He didn't deserve what happened to him.
Was the strangest thing.
He finally drove off, and he threw my purse right at me.
Then he actually said,
"I'm sorry."
He looked at me and he shook his head, like he was warning me, somehow telling me not to go inside.
He looked concerned, like he was, uh, trying to save me.
He made a mistake when he was younger, and it's haunted him ever since.
When he tried to get out, he was pressured even harder.
It was never his fault.
He's got a good heart.
Always had. Always will.
With regard to counts 1 through 19, and count 21,
I hereby sentence the defendant to 25 years in the federal penitentiary, subject to a parole hearing after five years served.

You got a letter, kid.
Hey, Baby.
You know, it's funny.
Even though I heard it so many times in the court case,
I still can't get used to the fact that your real name is Miles.
It's a cool name, though.
I can think of a lot of great Miles songs.
But we still have to get through all those Baby songs first.
I can't wait until the day when it's just us, music and the road.
See you later, Baby.
