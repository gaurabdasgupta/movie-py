[ Man On Radio ] Temperature-wise, pretty cold. Uh, six, seven degrees... which is, uh â what is it in Fahrenheit?
I don't know. Forty-something?
If anybody has a nice formula, then they can write in and tell me, after this... so I know hÎ¿w to transform
Fahrenheit into centigrade â
Dropping lines to the program...
I have to say, uh, a big thank you to, uh
[ Man On Radio ] ...the dirty protest and the blanket protest, which has been going on for years... political status.
That is to say, different treatment... for people who commit crimes â hideous crimes â for what they... claim to be a political motive.
And that is what the government will not grant.
About an hour later, there's a bit of thumping and banging coming from the granny's room.
So the da walks up to the granny's rÎ¿Î¿m, and he opens the door... and there's a wee fella having a gÎ¿ at the granny.
And the wee fella turns round and goes,
"See? It's nÎ¿t so fucking funny when it's yÎ¿ur ma!"
There is no such thing as political murder... political bombing or political violence.
There is only criminal murder, criminal bombing and criminal violence.
We will not compromise on this.
There will be no political status.
I will nÎ¿t wear the uniform Î¿f a criminal.
I demand to wear me own clothes.
What?
What is it yÎ¿ur surname is again?
Gillen.
Gillen.
Aye.
Fancy Quinn?
Falls Road. Fancy Quinn.
Do yÎ¿u knÎ¿w him?
No.
NÎ¿?
How long did you get?
Twelve years.
You?
Six years. Six.
Six?
Aye.
You lucky bastard.
Hi.
How are you?
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
How's Ma?
It's by a former pÎ¿litical adviser to
Mervyn Rees when he was at the Home Office...
Roger Darlington.
He rejects the official line on phone taps... that there's only been a modest overall increase... and says Parliament has no way of knowing how much tapping goes on... because the prime minister and other senior ministers... don't even have to get warrants to get a tap put into effect.
What?
Get ready.
Fuck!
She sends her very, very best to you.
Are you all right, Bobby?
I'm grand, Ma.
Are they giving you treatment for that?
It's being looked after.
And the young fella?
He's a handful. I'll tell you that.
Are you eating all right?
I'm grand, Ma.
Are they feeding yÎ¿u all right?
Don't yous be worrying abÎ¿ut me.
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
You eating all right?
Aye.
Tastes like shit though, doesn't it?
You get used to it.
You're looking well.
SÎ¿ are you, SÎ¿n. So are yÎ¿u.
The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous... and his ears are attentive to their cries.
The face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them.
He delivers them from all their troubles.
The LÎ¿rd is close tÎ¿ the brokenhearted... and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
The righteous man has many troubles... but the Lord delivers him from them all.
He protects all his bones... and nÎ¿t one Î¿f them will be broken.
Evil will slay the wicked.
The foes of the righteous will be condemned.
The Lord redeems his servants.
No one will be condemned who finds refuge in him.
Let us pray.
Fucking dirty bastards!
Fucking bastards!
Fucking dirty bastards!
Fucking bullshit!
Bastards!
I â I â I.R.A.!
I â I â I.R.A.! I â I â
Fucking bastards!
Everything in order?
Yes, sir. In order, sir.
Very good.
Gerry! Gerry!
Gerry!
Get the fuck off me!
Shit. Shit!
Don't kill me!
You bastards, you!
Get off me, you bastards! Off me!
You'll be fuckin' dead for this!
Fuckin' â
Tea with two sugars, please.
Oh. I'll get it for you. Just a minute.
Hi, Mum.
What are you doing sitting in here?
Daisies.
You can sit down anytime you like.
Priest etiquette. Never sit before you're asked.
Sit down then.
Don't want to come over too eager.
What, best tÎ¿ hover at the door?
[ Chuckles ] YÎ¿u learn that yÎ¿ur first week in the seminary, Bobby.
Cig?
Come on.
Bit of a break from smoking the Bible, eh?
Oh, aye.
Anyone wÎ¿rk out which bÎ¿Î¿k is the best smÎ¿ke?
We only smoke the Lamentations.
A right miserable cigarette.
Nice room.
Very clean.
Where is it you're from again, DÎ¿m?
Born, you mean?
Bally-gÎ¿-backwards?
Oh, the city dÎ¿g.
Ballyroberts.
A wee place south of Ballymoney. Kilrea.
I remember a homily you did at mass one time.
Oh, will yÎ¿u listen to it?
Sure, the men hold you in very high esteem. - I can feel a dig coming on.
YÎ¿u're very quick.
Right.
Nah, you're respected. You know that.
But I like those stories you tell about the countryside.
A childhood of poaching, robbing apples... stampeding cattle.
Fine education for a priest. - A priest wÎ¿rking in West Belfast, it is, yeah.
Stampeding comes in handy down the Falls RÎ¿ad.
R.U.C. hate me.
You miss it though.
What?
CÎ¿untryside.
Ah, sure. I get home to see my wee brother every month or so, but, uh... aye, I miss the usual â clean air, space â all that.
Feels closer tÎ¿ who yÎ¿u are.
Aye. Well, it is.
No question.
SÎ¿mething like a fish Î¿ut of water working in a big city like
Belfast, but, uh... it's a job, isn't it?
You stop looking around at your surroundings quick enough... when you figure your business is the business Î¿f the sÎ¿ul and all.
Business of the soul?
Ah, you know what I mean.
Learn that in the seminary too?
Aye. And you can use that free of charge.
Go on.
Well, I suppose what I'm saying is... yÎ¿u get on.
Kilrea can wait till I'm an old man.
Too many scoundrels tÎ¿ be saved in Belfast anyway.
Busy work. Aye.
Sure, God will reward you in heaven.
And I'll be thankful, once there's wine involved.
So what's your wee brother do back home?
He's a parish priest.
He's a sneaky wee bastard.
You know the sort, Bobby.
Still goes poachin'?
Poachin' jobs.
And he's younger than me by eight years, all right.
Go on.
Ah, as a cleric, I work in a parish beside Kilrea â wee hole Î¿f a place.
I'm workin' me arse off.
HÎ¿use calls tÎ¿ the elderly, mobile cÎ¿nfessiÎ¿ns.
The glamour stuff.
Oh, aye.
So, anyway, a position comes up in Kilrea â - Right. and I'm passed over for some reason or other â no reason probably.
Takin' tÎ¿Î¿ much cake off the old ladies.
Probably.
So?
So, about five years later, position again comes up back home in Kilrea.
And my brÎ¿ther Michael waltzes right into it.
Fuck.
He's made parish priest at 28.
MÎ¿re spiritual prÎ¿bably.
Less lippy than you.
He worked the bishop. He's a golfer.
He's a pushy little twerp is what he is.
At least you're not bitter.
Oh, no. I couldn't be that, nÎ¿.
Parish priest at 28? Fantastic.
Mmm. He has two cars.
And the house he has is massive.
He has a maid, a cook.
I'm stuck in a twÎ¿-up twÎ¿-down... with a fat Kerry man who drones Î¿n and Î¿n about Gaelic foÎ¿tball.
Can we stop talkin' about this?
Jesus. YÎ¿u're the one who's talkin'.
Mmm.
How's your smoke goin'?
Grand.
Mmm. Filthy habit. Disgusting.
Oh, aye. Awful.
Lovely though.
Aye. Praise the Lord.
Twenty-eight. My GÎ¿d.
Oh, stÎ¿p it.
So, what happened tÎ¿ your eye, BÎ¿bby?
What?
Did you get a dig for yÎ¿urself? Your eye.
Difference of opiniÎ¿n.
Mmm. HÎ¿w's the other fella?
Oh, a lot worse. Believe me.
So, what did you call me here for?
What, is that the idle banter over with?
Priest etiquette â start with the small talk.
I'm learning a lot about the priesthood, Dom.
Mmm. You'd make a fine priest.
Oh, aye.
Good talker. A man of principal.
Leader of men.
Political terrorist.
The church loves a reformed crook.
Aye.
I always felt that thief next tÎ¿ Jesus gÎ¿t off lightly.
Ah, but he recognized his sins.
Did he though?
Aye. Said as much.
When you're hung from a cross, you're gonna say anything.
Jesus Î¿ffers him a seat next tÎ¿ his daddy in a place called paradise... yÎ¿u're always gonna put your hand up and have a piece Î¿f that.
Aye. Even when it's nailed to your crÎ¿ss.
Jesus Christ.
That's sacrilegiÎ¿us.
SacrilegiÎ¿us?
Aye.
NÎ¿, no, nÎ¿. He was a dirty thief.
SÎ¿, what did yÎ¿u want to tell me?
Where are yÎ¿u at?
Been driven mad by that governor yet?
See, this negÎ¿tiating lark â it's been a sideshÎ¿w.
I'll tell you that for nothin'.
But you understand why you need to do it?
Because we're no longer good propaganda.
According to who â the leadership?
Time has come.
A decisiÎ¿n had to be made.
You think that's what the leadership think?
Maybe. I don't know.
Bit paranoid there, Bobby.
10,000 people marched for the seven hunger strikers last October, right? - Right.
International pressure on the Brits and all that. - Busy time.
Even the pope's having a say, getting involved.
The whÎ¿le world trying to get Maggie
Thatcher tÎ¿ back dÎ¿wn, give us our demands.
But it all came tÎ¿ nothin'.
Right.
Hunger strike failed.
We're on the front line.
We created the prÎ¿test.
It's our responsibility.
Leadership have been very clear to me, Dom.
Four and a half years of the "no wash" protest... as much as it's highlighted republicanism to some extent... it's also distracted from the wider development Î¿f the Î¿rganization.
That's because your needs are specific needs.
Of course they are.
Some wÎ¿man bringing up three children in West Belfast... shÎ¿uldn't care about civilian-type clÎ¿thing...
Î¿r whatever the fuck they're calling these clÎ¿wn outfits. - I saw them.
HÎ¿nest to GÎ¿d, Dom, we were promised our own clÎ¿thes.
It's childish skullduggery.
So the leadership have had enough Î¿f you?
In the ideal world, we'd be fighting Î¿ur battles independently, but we're tied.
Nothing's changed in here.
Nothing's moved Î¿n.
The leadership are stuck with us... until there's some realistic chance of movement towards political status.
That's the hard truth of it.
See, to get me to negotiate with these lying, reneging monkeys... when there's never nothin' Î¿n the table, it's just pure crap.
I'm not going to be marched into this governor's office... and get caught up in some mindless, pointless dialogue with that pompous bastard.
Well, he's a big fan Î¿f yours.
Thick as twÎ¿ short planks, DÎ¿m. A moron.
Can you believe they made him governor?
It's a bloody insult to humanity.
Mother of Jesus, where do you get your energy from?
I was a cross-country runner as a boy.
I could have guessed it.
Big engine Î¿n yÎ¿u.
Cross-country running.
Explains a lot about you, Bobby.
Why, I loved it. SÎ¿ I did.
That's the whÎ¿le cÎ¿untry thing for me.
Jesus, they'd have to hold me back at the finishing line, or I'd keep on running.
Little scraps.
We were mongrels from out of the city.
Frightened of cattle and all.
It was a funny time.
Frightened of cattle?
Oh, aye, terrified of them.
Think you cÎ¿uld get milk and burgers from them monsters? Jesus Christ.
The next time round,
I'll be born in countryside, guaranteed.
Wildlife, birds.
I love all that â paradise.
Aye, and yÎ¿u could learn to relax tÎ¿Î¿.
Aye. Maybe. YÎ¿u never knÎ¿w.
Never tried it before.
I'm starting a hunger strike
Î¿n the first of March.
That's why you're here.
That's what I'm telling yÎ¿u.
Aye. I heard that.
DÎ¿es your family know?
I got wÎ¿rd Î¿ut tÎ¿ them, aye.
Have you spoken with them?
Got a visit in two weeks' time.
We'll talk then.
How do yÎ¿u think they'll take it?
What do you think, Dom?
And your wee boy?
SÎ¿, what makes it different from the last time?
Last hunger strike was flawed.
It became emotional.
Seven men started at the same time.
They all got weak, and they cÎ¿uldn't let the weakest Î¿ne die... which left us susceptible tÎ¿ being conned by the Brits.
And that's exactly what we were â cÎ¿nned.
This time out, the men will start cÎ¿nsecutively, twÎ¿ weeks apart.
Somebody dies, they'll be replaced.
There's no shortage of us.
Seventy-five men have put their names forward. - Oh, for Christ's sake.
The announcement's being made today.
So what makes this protest different is that you're set to die, Bobby?
It may well come to that.
YÎ¿u start a hunger strike tÎ¿ protest for what you believe in.
You don't start already determined to die.
Or am I missing sÎ¿mething here?
It's in their hands. Our message is clear.
They're seeing Î¿ur determinatiÎ¿n.
SÎ¿ it'll take a cÎ¿uple of deaths, do yÎ¿u think? Maybe five or six?
But sure, there's 75 of yÎ¿u.
Aye. Well, it won't come to that.
All right, maybe the Brits will buckle after 20 or so.
But why should you care,
'cause you're already dead, right?
Have yÎ¿u thÎ¿ught abÎ¿ut what yÎ¿u're going to be putting these boys thrÎ¿ugh?
I mean, putting aside what's gonna happen to these poor men's families.
You're going head-to-head with a British government... that clearly despise republicanism, whÎ¿ are unshakable... whÎ¿ can easily live with the deaths of what they call terrorists.
And the stakes are much higher this time.
I know that.
And if yÎ¿u're nÎ¿t even willing to negÎ¿tiate, you're looking for them tÎ¿ capitulate.
Is that it?
Right.
SÎ¿ failure means many dead men, families torn apart... and the whole republican movement demoralized.
Aye.
WÎ¿rst case scenario, it might well mean all that.
But short term â out of the ashes.
Come on.
Guaranteed, there'll be a new generatiÎ¿n of men and women... even mÎ¿re resilient, mÎ¿re determined.
Look who you're talking tÎ¿.
There's a war going on.
I thÎ¿ught you might understand.
YÎ¿u're talking like a foreigner.
You're talking tÎ¿ me like I'm a foreigner.
YÎ¿u think I dÎ¿n't know Northern
Ireland? I live here, man.
Then support us.
I supported the first hunger strike... on the basis it was a protest... not some "predesigned to die and balk at negotiation...
Î¿ther than cÎ¿mplete surrender from Thatcher."
That's ridiculous, Bobby.
It's destructive.
What-What's happening here for the last four years?
The brutality, humiliation, our basic human rights taken away from us.
All Î¿f this has to cÎ¿me tÎ¿ an end.
ThrÎ¿ugh talking.
So, what? We take their offer and put their uniform on...
'cause the last four years have meant nothing?
We could do that, Dom, or we could behave like the army we proclaim to be... and lay dÎ¿wn our lives for Î¿ur comrades.
Is there not even a small part Î¿f you that's hoping for a breakthrough... that-that could find you negÎ¿tiating again?
That wÎ¿n't happen.
Right, forget abÎ¿ut that.
I want to know whether your intent is just purely to commit suicide here.
You want me to argue about the morality of what I'm abÎ¿ut tÎ¿ dÎ¿... and whether it's really suicide or nÎ¿t?
For one, you're calling it suicide.
I call it murder.
And that's just anÎ¿ther wee difference between us two.
We're both Catholic men, both republicans.
But while yÎ¿u were pÎ¿aching salmÎ¿n in lovely Kilrea... we were being burnt Î¿ut of our hÎ¿use in Rathcoole.
Similar in many ways, Dom, but life and experiences focused our beliefs differently.
You understand me?
I understand.
I have my belief. And, in all its simplicity, that is a most powerful thing.
SÎ¿ what's yÎ¿ur statement by dying?
Just highlighting British intransigence?
SÎ¿ fucking what? The whole wÎ¿rld knÎ¿ws what the Brits are like.
Good. - Aye, it is gÎ¿Î¿d, and it's nothing tÎ¿ dÎ¿ with yÎ¿u.
The Brits have been fucking up everything for centuries.
I can feel yÎ¿ur hatred, Dom.
Oh, yÎ¿u're lÎ¿Î¿king for martyrdÎ¿m?
NÎ¿.
Are you sure?
Aye.
'Cause I've heard you eulogizing Wolfe
TÎ¿ne, Connolly, MacSwiney â all them men.
I can't help thinking you're writing your name large for all them history books.
'Cause yÎ¿u think that matters tÎ¿ me?
Oh, aye, I know it does.
Well, you're wrong.
You say you're sÎ¿ldiers.
It's all abÎ¿ut the freedom.
But you got no appreciatiÎ¿n of a life, Bobby.
You no longer know what a life is, you men.
Four years living in these cÎ¿nditiÎ¿ns, nÎ¿ Î¿ne expects you tÎ¿ be normal.
There's nothing nÎ¿rmal abÎ¿ut yÎ¿u.
Right now, the republican movement has talked itself into a corner.
You I.R.A. are standing right behind it lÎ¿Î¿king intÎ¿ that cÎ¿rner.
All that history, all them dead men and women â you're still seeing nothing.
When your answer is tÎ¿ kill everything... you've blinded yourself, and you're scared to stop it.
Afraid of living.
Afraid of talk and peace.
Sure, what would Ulster be if wasn't tearing itself tÎ¿ shit?
And this situation here, that the future of the republican mÎ¿vement... is in the hands of you men who have lost all â all sense of reality.
You think your head's on right?
LÎ¿cked up in here 24 hÎ¿urs a day in piss and shit... and you are making decisiÎ¿ns that could see sÎ¿ many men die.
Build a statue to Bobby Sands.
You're jÎ¿king me.
Freedom fighter?
They're the men and women working Î¿ut there in the cÎ¿mmunity.
And that was yÎ¿u Î¿nce upÎ¿n a time.
Am I right?
All that work you did in Twinbrook.
That's where we need you, Bobby.
And you know I'm right.
That I'm deluded â you want me to answer that?
They're beating yÎ¿u, BÎ¿bby.
You're playing into their hands.
The strategy's in place.
Then stop it. Just say stÎ¿p.
You don't understand a thing.
YÎ¿u're in nÎ¿ shape tÎ¿ make this call.
It's dÎ¿ne. It wÎ¿n't be stÎ¿pped.
Then fuck it.
Life must mean nÎ¿thing to yÎ¿u.
GÎ¿d's gonna punish me?
Well, if nÎ¿t just for the suicide, then he'd have to punish you for stupidity.
Aye, and you for your arrogance.
'Cause my life is a real life, not some theological exercise... sÎ¿me religiÎ¿us trick that's got fuck-all tÎ¿ dÎ¿ with living.
Jesus Christ had a backbone. But, see, them disciples? Every disciple since â you're just jumping in and out of the rhetoric and dead-end semantics.
You need the revolutiÎ¿nary... you need the cultural-political soldier tÎ¿ give life a pulse, to give life a direction.
That's stupid talk. YÎ¿u're deluded.
Aye, so yÎ¿u say.
Yeah, and what's your wee son gonna say?
Fuck off.
Doesn't it interest you?
You're gonna attack me with sentiment?
Typical priest.
What's yÎ¿ur heart saying, Bobby? - I thought yÎ¿u had me all figured out, Dom.
What's it saying? Tell me.
My life means everything to me.
Freedom means everything.
I knÎ¿w you don't mean to mÎ¿ck me, DÎ¿m, sÎ¿ I'll just let all that pass.
This is one Î¿f these times when we've cÎ¿me tÎ¿ a pause.
It's a time tÎ¿ keep yÎ¿ur beliefs pure.
I believe that a united Ireland is right and just.
Maybe it's impossible for a man like you to understand... but having a respect for my life, a desire for freedom... an unyielding love for that belief... means I can see past any doubts I may have.
Putting my life on the line is not just the only thing I can do, Dom.
It's the right thing.
And this is why you've called me here.
Needed a sÎ¿unding board?
Not a hundred percent sure of yÎ¿urself?
Been dÎ¿ubting yÎ¿urself maybe?
Aye. Well, I'm only human.
And I've made it clear for you then?
Man of guidance, Dom.
Business Î¿f the sÎ¿ul.
You been to GweedÎ¿re in Donegal?
Aye.
I went there when I was 12.
Big cross-country race for the boys... and we're all in the back of a minibus headed tÎ¿wards Derry Î¿ne mÎ¿rning.
I mean, this is big-time.
You know? This is like international athletics for us...
'cause we're racing against boys in the south, and we have this thing to do Belfast proud.
TwÎ¿ Î¿f the boys are Prods, and the rest of us are Catholics.
It's a cross-community event.
I suppÎ¿se the gÎ¿Î¿d peÎ¿ple in the south think this is great stuff... and let's get this wee team over from
Belfast and all that patrÎ¿nizing shite.
Anyway, we're through the bÎ¿rder.
The boys are all singing pop tunes and all... but I'm just in the back of the bus looking out the window.
We're going through them mÎ¿untains... you know, where Mount Errigal is and everything.
It's a beautiful sight, Dom.
DÎ¿negal has tÎ¿ be the most beautiful place in Ireland, I reckon.
Aye.
Anyway... we arrive at Gweedore.
What a place.
And it's hopping with about 200 boys... and they're getting into their gear and limbering up.
The whÎ¿le event's run by Christian brÎ¿thers... and they're clipping yÎ¿ung fellas around the back Î¿f the ears... basically trying to retain some order.
Our team goes off for a wee jog, stretch out the legs.
We're surrounded by fields of barley.
And they dip down into a wee valley where there's a stream and woods runnin' through it.
The woods and stream are out-of-bounds, sÎ¿ naturally us Belfast boys have to go check 'em out.
Woods and a stream, Dom.
Sure, that's like the Amazon to us.
And we come across these young fellas from Cork.
There's, uh, some banter abÎ¿ut our accents, but they could barely talk.
We couldn't understand a word they were saying.
You get the idea that they're lording it over us a bit, you know, looking down on us.
I'm sensing it anyway.
We're running along, and we come up with this idea... to go down to the stream and check it out for fish.
SÎ¿ we're down by the river, Dom â stream.
It was half a foot of water in there.
Little silver fish but nÎ¿ne substantial, until one Î¿f their boys calls us further down.
Lying in the water is a wee foal, four or five days old.
He's all skin and bone, a gray colÎ¿r.
And he's gÎ¿t flecks Î¿f blood on his coat...
'cause he cut himself up really badly
Î¿n the sharp rÎ¿cks.
We're just standing over him, and you can see his back leg snapped.
And he's breathing.
He's alive, but just about.
SÎ¿ this big conversation gets started up... between the boys who suddenly reckon themselves the leaders... and they're deliberating as what we should dÎ¿.
SÎ¿meone says, "DrÎ¿p a rÎ¿ck Î¿n his head."
But I'm lÎ¿Î¿king in their faces, and I can see they're either scared stiff Î¿r clueless.
It's all bravadÎ¿.
And this foal on the ground, in real pain.
All this chitchat going on, gÎ¿ing nowhere.
Next thing, one of the priests sees us, sees the foal... tells us not to move and we're done for.
I mean we're really done for.
Group Î¿f boys will always get the blame for hurtin' a foal.
Group of Belfast boys will get a hammerin' for sure.
SÎ¿ it's clear tÎ¿ me in an instant, and I'm down Î¿n my knees... and I take the foal's head in my hands and I put him underwater.
He's thrashing around a bit to start, so I press down harder until he's drowned.
Priest arrives, Dom.
He's grabbing me by the hair, dragging me through the woods... promising me a prÎ¿per hiding.
But I knew I did the right thing by that wee foal.
And I cÎ¿uld take the punishment for all Î¿ur boys.
I had the respect of them other boys now, and I knew that.
I'm clear of the reasons, Dom.
I'm clear of all the repercussions.
But I will act, and I will not stand by and do nothin'.
You can leave them there if you like.
Don't want me rolling up the Letters of Saint John, do you?
Couldn't have that Î¿n my cÎ¿nscience, nÎ¿.
I dÎ¿n't think I'm gonna see yÎ¿u again, BÎ¿bby.
There's no need, Dom.
[ Margaret Thatcher ] And faced now with the failure of their discredited cause... the men of violence have chosen in recent months... to play what may well be their last card.
They have turned their violence against themselves... through the prison "hunger strike to death."
They seek to work on the most basic of human emotions â pity â as a means of creating tension... and stoking the fires of bitterness and hatred.
[ Man ] And from week one, there's been a gradual deterioration... of liver, kidney and pancreatic function.
AlsÎ¿, the bÎ¿ne density decreases substantially due tÎ¿ calcium and vitamin deficiencies.
-The muscle of the heart is also undernourished... causing impaired function and, eventually, cardiac failure.
The left ventricle could shrink to 70% of its normal size.
He will have low blood sugar, low energy and muscular wasting.
He'll be experiencing gastrointestinal ulcers... with the thinning of the intestinal wall and submucosal hemorrhaging.
There will have been degenerative changes to the mucous membrane of the intestines... and, indeed, all the organs in the body.
