You've got to stay on board.
You too, lieutenant.
Mm-hm.
I'm sorry.
It's probably just as well.
Who knows who they'd replace me with?
Might be one of those wet-behind-the-ears kids.

These are the British docks.

It will be well protected.

We'll move under cover of darkness, skimming the surface.
We'll cut right through the English ships.
As close to the Strait of Gibraltar as we can get.
Then we'll dive, and let ourselves drop.

Some air may be left in the ballast tanks, from all that blowing.
That might help us.
