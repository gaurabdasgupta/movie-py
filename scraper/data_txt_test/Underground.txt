{1968}{2024}I'll kill them!
{2432}{2492}Don't, it's dangerous!
{2706}{2799}lvan, my brother!
{2803}{2854}The Vice-President spoke | of increased cooperation
{2858}{2928}between the two nations | of Yugoslavia.
{3210}{3297}That's my brother...
{3301}{3356}and his best friend, Blacky!

{5743}{5772}Not on the lips, fucker!
{5775}{5848}Blacky! | Get in the house!
{5851}{5896}She's like this every morning!
{5899}{6021}I'll leave you, | just like Marko's wife left him.

{28914}{28982}What have you done?
{28986}{29084}Nothing. Last night, | we roughed up a few thieves.

{55964}{55998}Congratulations, miss.
{56001}{56036}I'm not getting married!
{56039}{56107}Yes, you are. | You just don't know it yet.
{56152}{56249}So, I ruined your life by killing Franz. | Thank you, Natalija!
{56252}{56304}Who gets Bato's medicine, | you or Franz?
{56336}{56410}- You only bring me stolen gold! | - From traitors.
{56440}{56477}Come to your senses.
{56481}{56511}Listen to me...
{56515}{56570}I've never loved anyone so much.
{56573}{56650}But respect some rules. | No collaborating with the enemy!
{56653}{56678}Right!
{56682}{56749}What do you mean? | I'm just an actress.
{56785}{56848}The bakeries are working!
{56852}{56903}Yes, but you're not a baker.
{56907}{56949}You don't sell pies.
{56953}{56988}You sell your soul.
{56991}{57081}I personally will judge those | who sell their soul.
{57085}{57176}First, I'll kill the manager | of your theatre.
{57189}{57270}I'll strangle him with my bare hands... | because I love the theatre!
{57790}{57842}Congratulations, Mr. Blacky!
{58177}{58280}Will this dinner eat us | before we eat it?
{58303}{58357}Get that fish grilled properly.
{58360}{58410}No problem!
{58461}{58546}Have you no shame? | Others help wounded partisans
{58549}{58613}while you perform | for the bastards!
{58695}{58729}It hurts!
{58732}{58772}So now it hurts you!
{58809}{58836}I love you.
{58912}{58944}Golub!
{58986}{59018}Grill it!
{59031}{59079}Follow me, I'm going for a pee.
{59112}{59157}Watch my bride, my friend.
{59185}{59224}Let's go!
{59606}{59636}Marko!
{59919}{59956}Come on! Follow me!
{60196}{60231}I don't want to!
{60613}{60662}I don't want to get married!
{60697}{60772}Golub, I won't leave the partisans | to sort you all out.
{60775}{60807}There's no need.
{60811}{60868}You may not know this
{60871}{60985}but he's not | an electrical engineer at all.
{61030}{61134}No, he's a common electrician. | A pole-man!
{61170}{61221}He spent his whole life on poles,
{61244}{61284}with pliers and cutters.
{61287}{61413}I'm the one who got him down | and asked him: "Comrade,
{61417}{61475}"will you join our side?" | "Yes," he said.
{61478}{61561}"Will you obey the rules
{61564}{61608}"and the orders?" | "Yes."
{61612}{61641}Until...
{61644}{61677}he got rich!
{61741}{61765}Natalija!
{61879}{61914}An electrician?
{61943}{61982}A pole-man!
{62067}{62176}Natalija, | you are our greatest actress
{62180}{62268}and our suffering people | need you.
{62272}{62396}And you need | a reasonable, intelligent,
{62400}{62448}educated man...
{62481}{62508}An intellectual!
{62554}{62597}You're right!
{62879}{62962}Comrade Leka will bring you | to the disciplinary committee.
{62966}{63051}We expected the guns a week ago. | Where are they?
{63055}{63146}On the boat. | As soon as I get married, off we go!
{63149}{63209}They can hear the music | in Belgrade!
{63212}{63258}Good! | It's Blacky's wedding.
{63262}{63304}We've had enough crying.
{63383}{63443}Are these arms or what?
{63566}{63604}Once the priest marries me,
{63617}{63658}I'll be at the White Rock | before you.
{63661}{63742}Comrade Tito!
{63761}{63884}When will you reach Uzice
{64126}{64182}"Your hands, so white
{64197}{64298}"So tender, so soft | As the wings of a bird
{64302}{64399}"Oh, to see them fly | and land on my face..."
{64870}{64894}That's enough!
{64923}{64952}Get out!
{65032}{65074}What are you doing to me?
{65078}{65133}We're just talking | about the theatre.
{65153}{65188}What?
{65204}{65265}I'll kill myself, I swear!
{65280}{65312}Don't, my friend!
{65390}{65476}You know, | I killed two men because of her!
{65479}{65503}I know.
{65520}{65559}Why do this to me?
{65562}{65606}- As for you... | - It wasn't me!
{65609}{65645}Wasn't you?
{65648}{65682}It was me, then?
{65881}{65953}Are you my best friend?
{65956}{65991}I'm your best friend.
{65994}{66046}I didn't hear. | Are you my best friend?
{66049}{66074}I'm your best friend.
{66105}{66144}Whose wedding is this?
{66148}{66227}Ours, my love! Our wedding!
{66230}{66269}Yours, my friend.
{66272}{66306}- Our wedding, sweetheart. | - Ours, my love!
{66470}{66584}You wanted a ride, did you? | Well, giddy-up, you stud!
{67257}{67291}Where's the priest?
{67309}{67359}He'll be here any minute now.
{67385}{67514}Is it moonlight at noon
{67623}{67725}Is it sunshine at midnight
{67810}{67897}From the skies above | Light is beaming...
{67926}{67977}The Germans! A catastrophe!
{67981}{68089}Nobody knows, nobody knows
{68092}{68170}What is really shining
{68231}{68324}The two of you | could make one good man!
{68364}{68404}You pest!
{68487}{68573}Get out of the cars! | Spread out!
{68576}{68619}Left and right of the boat!
{68792}{68840}Marko!
{68875}{68927}Petar Popara!
{68947}{68997}You fools!
{69023}{69064}You can't play cat and mouse!
{69067}{69093}Franz!
{69097}{69149}Come out now!
{69174}{69260}And bring Natalija with you | or I'll shoot you all!
{69264}{69345}How come? I killed him.
{69349}{69374}You didn't.
{69378}{69420}He wears a bullet-proof vest.
{69424}{69464}Aim at his head next time.
{69468}{69549}I'll smoke one more cigarette.
{69552}{69614}And then my patience runs out.
{69618}{69691}After that, | I want you out in the open.
{69731}{69757}Do you hear me?
{69841}{69877}Don't shoot!
{69881}{69930}Don't shoot!
{70146}{70170}Catastrophe!
{70288}{70330}My sweet saviour!
{70371}{70398}My dearest...
{70512}{70559}Schulz, get out!
{70761}{70799}Now let's send
{70803}{70882}this shit-load of criminals | back where they belong!
{70886}{70979}My little white dove!
{71265}{71326}Have fun, you idiots!
{71348}{71409}You won't forget me in a hurry!
{71731}{71772}Shoot, my friend!
{71848}{71881}Golub, don't shoot!
{71912}{71938}Catastrophe!
{71941}{71990}Shoot, my friend!
{72300}{72332}Where are the weapons, Blacky?
{72420}{72480}Where are the trains | with the weapons, bastard?
{72551}{72593}Treacherous swine!
{72707}{72772}I'll fry Tito out of your head!
{73759}{73784}Well?
{73815}{73845}Is he talking?
{73870}{73944}No. He just keeps cursing.
{74012}{74041}Petar Popara!
{74045}{74123}Fucking fascist motherfucker!
{74314}{74346}You'll talk!
{74357}{74430}Keep on raising the current.
{74491}{74550}Marry uncle Blacky, sis.
{74553}{74600}He's the greatest.
{74603}{74631}Forget uncle Blacky!
{74635}{74664}Here's Franz!
{74667}{74706}Blacky's the greatest!
{74710}{74738}Stop pestering me.
{74741}{74808}What did he say?
{74812}{74911}He asked when he can be released.
{74955}{74992}Next week, my boy.
{75040}{75092}He can go | to a sanatorium in Austria.
{75096}{75153}A sanatorium in Austria?
{75156}{75246}Yes, he'll be safe there.
{75250}{75305}I can't help him here. | It's too dangerous.
{75496}{75520}Good morning!
{75553}{75581}Good morning!
{75646}{75727}Did the kid vomit during the night?
{75787}{75817}Yes.
{75845}{75883}No.
{75887}{75932}Did he...
{75975}{76017}or didn't he?
{76050}{76088}I don't know.
{76114}{76154}Well, he didn't.
{76185}{76226}Tell him
{76230}{76261}that he must not worry. | Please, tell him...
{76457}{76500}Burst him!
{76503}{76549}Burst him like a paper bag!
{76596}{76653}Let go of him!
{76657}{76698}Like a bag!
{76702}{76738}Burst him like a bag!
{76789}{76839}You killed my Franz!
{77083}{77122}Is he dead?
{77161}{77221}Not yet!
{77250}{77310}Forgive me, Franz. I'm sorry.
{77563}{77604}Damn your Franz! Come on.
{77790}{77863}- What's wrong with this shit? | - Put it on level 5.
{77866}{77909}It might kill him.
{77912}{77948}Kill me... my ass!
{77951}{77985}Let me try.
{78134}{78162}It doesn't work.
{78300}{78329}Switch it on.
{78618}{78644}Hey, man,
{78648}{78689}wake up!
{78692}{78734}Good afternoon.
{78758}{78835}Let's see what's going on.
{78950}{78988}What's wrong?
{78992}{79021}He tested the generator.
{79024}{79058}Is it working?
{79062}{79111}Yes, he's dead!
{79115}{79199}- That one didn't flinch. | - He's an electrician.
{79203}{79231}An electrician?
{79250}{79296}A pole-man!
{79616}{79650}My friend...
{79657}{79739}Give me a grenade. | If they catch me, I'll choose.
{79742}{79795}Here you are. Let's go.
{79919}{79958}Thank you, Marko.
{80053}{80123}Those crazy people | are so sad...
{80127}{80153}Indeed.
{80365}{80421}We're all crazy, Natalija.
{80544}{80653}We just haven't been... | diagnosed yet.
{80711}{80756}Where's uncle Blacky?
{80780}{80831}In the trunk, my boy.
{80834}{80873}In the trunk?
{81061}{81089}In the trunk?
{81126}{81157}Uncle Blacky!
{81315}{81422}Fucking fascist motherfuckers!
{81704}{81741}lvan!
{81744}{81782}Golub!
{81805}{81856}Get some bandages ready! | Hang on, my friend!
{81889}{81944}Bring the bandages, | for fuck's sake!
{81948}{82002}Come and help. Hold Jovan.
{82005}{82031}Jovan!
{82065}{82133}Fuck the monkey, help the man!
{82347}{82376}Pedal faster.
{82379}{82437}We need more light.
{82455}{82490}Mind his leg!
{82493}{82581}God, Comrade Blacky, | what did they do to you?
{82584}{82648}Fucking fascist motherfuckers!
{82683}{82728}Catastrophe!
{82731}{82793}Jovan...
{82797}{82823}Comrade Marko!
{82838}{82885}Call your grandad, | he'll cure him.
{82888}{82935}The water from the well | is medicinal.
{82964}{82991}Gently...
{83013}{83068}Tell the comrades about the arms.
{83071}{83126}Don't worry, I'll see to the weapons.
{83130}{83166}Look at Jovan!
{83169}{83211}Your son!
{83214}{83247}This is your dad.
{83251}{83297}Show him his dad!
{83300}{83427}Jovan! My son!
{83557}{83627}Give your dad a kiss! | Kiss your dad!
{84540}{84617}This room is dedicated to me!
{84716}{84750}My room!
{84773}{84800}Right...
{84822}{84865}Yes!
{84868}{84978}This room and this house!
{84981}{85107}And this country and the sky, | stars, rain, sun, moon and clouds...
{85133}{85189}even when the sky is bright!
{85219}{85244}It's all mine...
{85285}{85338}Yes. All of it!
{85740}{85812}- Who's bombing us now? | - The Allies.
{85815}{85892}When it's not the Germans, | the Allies bomb us.
{85948}{85972}Where are you going?
{86009}{86036}To the cellar.
{86039}{86064}Come to me!
{86077}{86116}Come to me!
{86215}{86247}Are you afraid?
{86280}{86341}Not when I'm with you.
{86561}{86587}Drink up!
{86591}{86632}You know I don't drink.
{86635}{86678}Don't be afraid, drink!
{86859}{86886}It's sweet, not strong!
{86889}{86936}Indeed...
{87298}{87403}"I do not know, my dear | If this is a dream
{87438}{87484}"What year it is | And what day
{87518}{87593}"And I don't know, my dear | If I am yours
{87628}{87734}"Or if you are my dream"
{87780}{87834}Who did you write that for?
{87850}{87884}Confess!
{87887}{87914}For you.
{87964}{87988}You're lying!
{88066}{88092}You're lying...
{88096}{88120}I'm not lying.
{88142}{88168}You're lying.
{88172}{88202}I never lie.
{88274}{88302}Never!
{88306}{88334}Never!
{88397}{88506}Marko, you lie so beautifully.
{88942}{88976}Easter, April, 1944
{88979}{89027}The Allied bombs destroyed
{89031}{89096}what the Nazis | had left of Belgrade...
{90134}{90229}Freedom!
{91812}{91873}...from our homeland. | They try to tear out
{91876}{91938}part of our body.
{91942}{92013}With guns, we won the plebiscite!
{92016}{92071}With guns, | we defended freedom!
{92075}{92124}With guns, | we'll defend Trieste!
{93087}{93152}Part Two - The Cold War
{93162}{93224}Years passed, Marko became
{93227}{93284}a close collaborator of Tito.
{93288}{93342}In Belgrade, in 1961, he paid his debt
{93346}{93389}to his great friend, Blacky.
{93837}{93863}Comrade Marko...
{93866}{93988}I must ask you again... | Could Comrade Natalija be in the film?
{93992}{94020}No.
{94023}{94076}But this film | is based on your memoirs
{94080}{94133}and she is our greatest actress!
{94137}{94254}Exactly. The film is dedicated | to the Revolution, not to us.
{94258}{94352}Will you at least visit the set? | We'd be honoured.
{94355}{94382}That we will do.
{94385}{94444}Comrades...
{94448}{94546}it is my honour to inaugurate | this Cultural Centre
{94550}{94671}as well as unveil the statue | of our Hero, Petar Popara Blacky.
{94697}{94774}Blacky symbolizes | our anti-fascist struggle!
{94791}{94915}His image and work will forever | be remembered by us, his friends,
{94918}{94956}his comrades in arms,
{94960}{95043}and by future generations | who from early youth
{95046}{95122}will come to this Cultural Centre
{95125}{95198}to inspire themselves | with the ideas for which
{95201}{95320}our brother, our comrade, | our friend,
{95324}{95438}our Blacky gave his life and youth.
{95876}{95931}I'll use this occasion,
{95934}{96041}even if it means taking your time, | to quote some lines
{96044}{96128}from my last book of poems | on the Struggle for Freedom.
{96309}{96434}"Why is the wind always blowing | when we remember our beloved?
{96472}{96569}"Why does the wind beat the windows | and doors of our brothers?
{96597}{96743}"Is the wind only blowing | or is the sky crying with us?"
{96777}{96837}Petar Popara Blacky, our friend!
{96840}{96880}We honour your memory!
{96884}{96933}We honour his memory!
{97066}{97133}Is it moonlight at noon
{97217}{97270}Is it sunshine at midnight
{97330}{97414}From the skies above | Light is beaming
{97417}{97500}Nobody knows, nobody knows...
{98274}{98348}The Soviet divisions | are surrounded.
{98352}{98473}General von Kleist's armoured units | have breached their lines...
{98526}{98582}That's it, girl!
{98771}{98802}More light!
{98856}{98880}Dad!
{98885}{98910}Dad!
{98977}{99001}Bring some water!
{99033}{99061}What happened?
{99166}{99200}Nothing, my friend.
{99203}{99255}The Gestapo tortured me.
{99258}{99292}Fucking fascist motherfuckers!
{99295}{99355}Fucking fascist motherfuckers!
{99412}{99518}Let me go out with you | and the war will be over in 3 days.
{99521}{99580}- Not yet. | - Why wait?
{99583}{99648}Tito orders you to wait.
{99651}{99692}Tito?
{99810}{99856}He said to me:
{99859}{99960}"Give Blacky my regards | and tell him not to move.
{99963}{100027}"He'll be precious to me | in the final battle."
{100031}{100081}- He said that? | - Every word.
{100084}{100124}He sent you a watch.
{100311}{100377}No, Marko, I can't...
{100380}{100415}With a dedication!
{100418}{100446}To me?
{100556}{100586}To you.
{100816}{100915}Comrade Tito
{100918}{101035}we swear
{101039}{101091}to you
{101094}{101205}We swear to you
{101208}{101291}Comrade Tito
{101295}{101413}we swear to you
{101517}{101641}That we won't
{101644}{101708}abandon your path
{102397}{102518}Comrade Tito
{102521}{102548}you, the hope of the people
{102671}{102744}You're loved
{102748}{102834}by the old
{102837}{102956}and the young
{102960}{103112}Comrade Tito
{103116}{103260}our spring flower
{103263}{103346}Serbia
{103349}{103468}will not forget you
{103585}{103711}A blue violet
{103715}{103861}has bloomed
{103865}{104025}On the pillow | where Tito's head rests
{104263}{104321}Congratulations, Blacky!
{104324}{104440}Shake hands with Comrade Marko. | Not with me, with Comrade Marko.
{104575}{104613}Are we having a bath?
{104678}{104709}Aren't we?
{104712}{104738}Yes, a bath!
{104809}{104860}What about our business, grandad?
{104863}{104901}It's... difficult!
{104958}{105007}Are you working on the time?
{105010}{105093}I'm reducing the hours for them | as you said.
{105096}{105144}Six hours per day!
{105165}{105221}Don't overdo it, okay?
{105250}{105343}In 20 years, | I've saved them 5 years.
{105346}{105396}You can imagine what 5 years less
{105400}{105464}in a cellar means?
{106406}{106501}Air raid! Come on, comrades!
{106504}{106564}Let's go! Hurry up! | Leave the weapons!
{106567}{106628}Everybody in the tank!
{106632}{106704}The aggressor | is attacking again!
{106708}{106793}Don't panic! | Where are you going, you donkey?
{106929}{107022}Hurry up, woman. | We'll all get killed because of you.
{107112}{107138}Hurry!
{107670}{107899}Comrade Tito, | we swear to you...
{108150}{108192}Tito, Tito, Tito!
{108194}{108252}Everyone sang the same song
{108256}{108313}and believed that outside
{108317}{108372}the fascists of World War II
{108375}{108421}were still in power...
{109100}{109140}What are you doing, Marko?
{109204}{109242}You'll see.
{110305}{110393}Ringe ringe raja | Here comes uncle Paja
{110614}{110659}And now?
{110714}{110743}Natalija!
{112701}{112760}Natalija, Spring is coming
{112764}{112799}on a white horse!
{112803}{112866}Stop! Cut!
{112870}{112904}Cut!
{112907}{112959}Why stop?
{112990}{113022}What for? Why stop now?
{113026}{113111}Yugoslav, fuck you and that water! | You call that rain?
{113114}{113154}Stop! Okay!
{113157}{113202}Will you ever simply say: act?
{113206}{113255}When'll you tell me to act?
{113282}{113330}Thank you, lads. Take a break.
{113333}{113377}Put the water back on!
{113466}{113526}Here he comes! Music!
{114259}{114335}Spring is Coming on a White Horse. | Scene 34a, take 2.
{114339}{114367}Action!
{114391}{114428}The Germans!
{114662}{114720}Natalija, darling!
{114723}{114798}Spring has arrived | on its white horse.
{115169}{115212}Rape!
{115441}{115489}No one will catch
{115492}{115575}Petar Popara, alias Blacky!
{115578}{115614}Natalija!
{116277}{116371}Long live the Communist Party | of Yugoslavia!
{116423}{116447}Rape!
{116556}{116607}Cut! Stop the camera!
{116611}{116678}Comrade Marko!
{116733}{116778}Get up all of you!
{116799}{116827}Stop the rain!
{116831}{116929}Comrade artists, | be happy in your work.
{116952}{116997}You are portraying...
{117030}{117102}great people
{117105}{117141}who are no longer with us.
{117145}{117252}We owe them a tribute. | Future generations must remember them.
{117256}{117304}May you live long, comrade artists!
{117401}{117435}Music!
{117921}{117983}Cheers, Comrade Marko!
{118032}{118069}Comrade Marko...
{118096}{118178}allow me to introduce | the heroes of your memoirs.
{118316}{118376}Get lost! Not now!
{118529}{118570}Are you me?
{118614}{118684}Marko! | Yes, I am you.
{118763}{118802}Unbelievable!
{118931}{118977}He looks just like me.
{119009}{119040}Where did you find them?
{119043}{119092}Casting is half my job.
{119095}{119173}Really? Unbelievable!
{119177}{119248}We're cut of the same cloth | and swapped our books for rifles.
{119312}{119391}"Shoot, my rifle, | for mother to hear you.
{119394}{119458}"Never will I abandon my country | to anyone."
{119483}{119519}Well, say hello.
{119560}{119595}What do you say?
{119598}{119632}She's so sweet!
{119636}{119680}Indeed!
{119707}{119741}Franz?
{119764}{119788}Franz the vampire.
{119819}{119958}It's very nice here | but I feel someone is missing.
{119962}{120012}God, is he the real Franz | or an actor?
{120016}{120053}Who knows?
{120057}{120082}An actor.
{120086}{120133}Yes, an actor...
{120137}{120259}Unbelievable! | It's all just like that night...
{120263}{120337}When you killed 11 Germans, | dived into the river...
{120340}{120397}- What a memory! | ...and saved Blacky and Natalija.
{120437}{120462}Indeed!
{120510}{120534}Excuse me, please.
{120632}{120658}Blacky!
{121002}{121056}My friend!
{121101}{121144}God, Blacky...
{121215}{121279}Why did they kill you, my friend? | Why did they kill you?
{121369}{121429}Can someone protect the actors | in this film?
{121432}{121495}I've been burnt | three times already!
{121498}{121529}Three times!
{121866}{121933}Comrade Marko, | it will be a great film!
{122239}{122273}Are you afraid of God?
{122276}{122327}You mean, | are we afraid of God?
{122575}{122660}You'd better learn that text | as it's written.
{122664}{122754}Word by word. Understand?
{123342}{123380}Sleep tight.
{123705}{123735}What is this?
{123864}{123905}What you'll tell him
{123909}{123933}in the cellar.
{124042}{124074}This?
{124106}{124206}You know, trash like this,
{124209}{124258}whoever the writer
{124262}{124304}or the director may be, | is still trash.
{124308}{124350}If they ask me what I think,
{124354}{124394}here's what I think!
{124488}{124559}You're a poet, Marko!
{124562}{124586}Stick to poems!
{124590}{124649}Natalija, what's missing?
{124652}{124699}What's missing?
{124702}{124729}The truth!
{124732}{124767}The truth?
{124771}{124795}Yes, darling!
{124799}{124856}You know, the truth...
{125130}{125179}No text, my dear, | has any truth in it.
{125182}{125285}The truth exists only in real life.
{125320}{125369}You are the truth!
{125399}{125439}You!
{125443}{125529}You are supposed to be the truth.
{125551}{125600}There is no truth, | only your conviction
{125603}{125668}that what you act is the truth.
{125732}{125784}No, art is a lie,
{125787}{125839}a big lie!
{125843}{125905}We are all liars, | a little bit at least.
{126032}{126076}You scum!
{127035}{127143}They raped me, beat me...
{127146}{127220}What else did they do to me? | What?
{127223}{127277}Does it really matter if | those people in the cellar stay alive?
{127281}{127335}Yes it does, my dear.
{127367}{127429}You write heroic roles for yourself
{127432}{127492}and I get to play the whore.
{127495}{127561}Anyone can fuck your wife!
{127603}{127650}Get dressed | and put the make-up on.
{127682}{127762}I said I'd rescue you | in time for the wedding.
{127861}{127895}Come on, please.
{127899}{127939}Please, get dressed | and put your make-up on.
{127942}{127972}I said no.
{128017}{128057}I said no!
{128104}{128202}I can't act a part | I don't believe in.
{129464}{129494}Look what they did to her!
{129524}{129554}Fucking fascist
{129557}{129582}motherfuckers!
{129927}{129972}I love you!
{130044}{130071}Hear that?
{130254}{130299}She said she loved me...
{130362}{130394}What?
{130397}{130436}Did you hear that?
{130522}{130546}And you?
{130673}{130719}She said she loved me.
{133944}{133981}He's just like me!
{134721}{134797}Dear friends, | welcome to my son's wedding...
{134801}{134825}Cut it out!
{134872}{134934}This day has come at last.
{134937}{135040}My son, dad has bought gold rings. | Give one to your bride.
{135080}{135190}Do not be offended | by the modesty of the wedding meal.
{135193}{135252}What can we do? | There's a war on.
{135256}{135345}But everything we offer | is offered from the heart!
{135348}{135384}And if there was no war...
{135425}{135508}And if the times were any better, | and if his mother was alive...
{135513}{135548}Keep it happy, my friend!
{135552}{135576}Thank you, my friend!
{135616}{135667}Comrades...
{135671}{135737}This is the right moment | for all of us
{135740}{135881}to thank Comrade Marko | from the bottom of our hearts
{135885}{135934}for all these years | during which
{135938}{136069}he has looked after us, | fed us and tended to us.
{136072}{136132}I want to say: | Thank you, my Marko!
{136167}{136232}Thank you, Comrade Marko!
{136516}{136540}Sit down!
{136544}{136627}Last month, we produced | 200 light weapons.
{136630}{136660}Is that nothing?
{136664}{136689}No, it's not!
{136693}{136722}Bravo!
{136725}{136750}Thanks, Marko!
{136754}{136849}But our greatest success | is our tank,
{136852}{136933}the one we made | with our own hands!
{136937}{137017}I am happy and proud of the fact | that the time will soon come
{137021}{137152}when we shall use our tank | to liberate our country for good!
{137156}{137227}Tank... forward!
{137331}{137378}Congratulations, comrades!
{137429}{137458}Congratulations!
{137674}{137706}Thank you, uncle Marko.
{138686}{138745}Whose brats are these?
{138748}{138809}They belong to us all. | Play, you fucker!
{138883}{138932}We...
{138936}{139040}The two of us made this together...
{139044}{139110}You shouldn't have. | Thank you, lvan.
{139304}{139350}Come on, | I have something to tell you.
{139441}{139493}I need a quick word with him.
{139627}{139663}Listen...
{139666}{139753}as soon as everyone's drunk, | we'll get out to fight.
{139757}{139799}Not a drop until Liberation!
{139861}{139898}Marko will be angry.
{139902}{139959}I've waited for Marko, the Russians, Tito | and the Party
{139962}{140011}for 15 years! | The time's never right.
{140016}{140050}The time is now!
{140054}{140100}Let's kill the scum and end the war!
{140103}{140139}That's it, my son!
{140176}{140201}Let's go!
{140551}{140590}You little bastards!
{143360}{143450}Stop drinking, Natalija.
{143454}{143496}- Give me the bottle back. | - What?
{143500}{143547}- The bottle! | - I'll give you the bottle all right!
{143551}{143575}Here!
{143713}{143762}Stop drinking when I tell you.
{143792}{143882}I would but I can't look at you | when I'm sober.
{143885}{143938}You can't look at me | but you can look at him?
{143942}{144012}I thought I could | but I can't either.
{144015}{144065}You can't look at him either?
{144078}{144148}See this? | This is for you.
{144193}{144255}And this is for him.
{144337}{144467}I drink brandy and you've been drinking my | blood for 20 years, motherfucker!
{144487}{144555}Natalija, you fucking bitch!
{144558}{144646}Fuck you and your fucking mother too!
{144710}{144747}Where's Blacky?
{144877}{144914}How are you?
{145552}{145663}Darling! What is it, darling?
{145667}{145738}You're crying!
{145741}{145781}Why are you crying?
{145785}{145812}I don't know.
{145850}{145889}Are you happy?
{145892}{145942}Yes, I'm happy!
{145965}{146009}Are you crying | because you're happy?
{146167}{146294}Is it moonlight at noon
{146412}{146503}Is it sunshine at midnight
{146581}{146681}From the skies above | Light is beaming
{146685}{146752}Nobody knows, nobody knows
{146776}{146871}Nobody knows, nobody knows
{146875}{146950}What is really shining
{147513}{147541}Motherfucker!
{147588}{147614}What's wrong with you?
{147618}{147670}My time has come at last!
{147698}{147731}Cut it out!
{147791}{147917}You too! Here you are! | I've had enough of both of you!
{147921}{147959}Enough!
{148114}{148173}You pathetic little man!
{148211}{148241}What do you want?
{148322}{148363}What's wrong, Natalija?
{148366}{148394}I wasted my youth!
{148397}{148422}What youth?
{148425}{148559}Twenty years! Twenty years | of my blood-stained life!
{148562}{148604}This is a catastrophe!
{149037}{149080}This brandy's good!
{149090}{149141}It's strong! Real strong stuff.
{149392}{149468}The monkey's getting into the tank!
{149472}{149501}A catastrophe!
{149809}{149843}The gun's moving!
{149846}{149914}He's moving it! A catastrophe!
{149976}{150003}Some wine, Natalija?
{150063}{150161}Shit, I lost!
{150233}{150271}And I chose the rules.
{150392}{150437}If there was no war...
{150484}{150564}Otchy
{150568}{150624}tchernye...
{150628}{150698}Otchy strasnye...
{150734}{150848}I'd have been the leading lady | of the Moscow State Theatre.
{150851}{150917}I'd have performed | in my mother tongue...
{150945}{150985}What's this rubbish?
{150989}{151092}Since when has your mother | been Russian?
{151096}{151137}You're drunk!
{151166}{151211}Listen to me...
{151215}{151295}You can't talk to her | as if she was your wife!
{151298}{151328}Understood?
{151332}{151372}You're absolutely right!
{151375}{151443}Every good party | needs a Russian song!
{151635}{151701}Without the war, I'd have been
{151705}{151761}the Yugoslav Ma√Øakovski.
{151782}{151817}I'd have gone to his grave | in Moscow,
{151821}{151865}bowed and said:
{151868}{151944}"You were heard from the heavens | like thunder.
{151947}{152032}"We marched along behind you." | Left! Left!
{152110}{152160}No one will listen.
{152163}{152222}The monkey's in the tank!
{152225}{152255}He's smart.
{152258}{152287}- It's a catastrophe! | - Get lost!
{152357}{152390}What did you want to tell me?
{152409}{152471}Something terrible.
{152504}{152536}So tell me.
{152555}{152622}Later, I don't want | to spoil the wedding.
{152626}{152668}Tell me, don't worry.
{152722}{152748}What?
{152772}{152851}You love Marko, right? | I know that.
{152929}{152958}- It's not that. | - It is!
{152962}{153002}- It's not. | - It is!
{153006}{153101}It's not that. I wanted to tell you | this is all a lie.
{153104}{153166}Our whole life is a lie.
{153169}{153222}And I can't live without you!
{153244}{153284}You can't?
{153322}{153347}Oh, come on...
{153439}{153483}Music!
{153486}{153520}Stop the music!
{153561}{153588}Did you hear what I said?
{153618}{153693}My son! Listen carefully | to what I say.
{153697}{153753}Never trust a lying woman.
{153757}{153796}I won't, dad!
{154569}{154656}You're frightened, Colonel, | aren't you?
{154659}{154712}Stop drinking and talking rubbish!
{154715}{154748}Frightened?
{154751}{154783}Colonel...
{154787}{154856}I'll kill you! | I swear to God I will!
{154927}{155011}How could you kill me? | I've been dead for twenty years.
{155038}{155113}Try it. Maybe they'll promote you | to Secret Service General.
{155146}{155171}Stop it!
{155291}{155388}You couldn't give me a child, | so kill me!
{155392}{155437}Maybe you can manage that!
{155440}{155530}You're evil!
{155586}{155610}What am I?
{155652}{155714}A murderer! A criminal!
{155717}{155748}A thief!
{155752}{155803}So I'm evil?
{155806}{155849}- Worse than that. | - Worse?
{155853}{155945}Do you know why I'm so evil? | Do you?
{155949}{156005}Do you know why?
{156009}{156040}You're damned!
{156044}{156091}Because I love you.
{156095}{156134}I love you!
{156258}{156296}When you fell for me,
{156300}{156408}you put these people down here | to live, die and work for you!
{156412}{156471}Because I love you, | don't you see?
{156474}{156526}I can't live without you!
{156529}{156579}Do they miss anything?
{156609}{156640}Yes, a lot!
{156694}{156770}You dragged me | into your crime...
{156850}{156903}because you love me?
{156938}{156981}Only because I love you!
{156985}{157047}What else do I have? | Children? Friends?
{157050}{157094}You have nothing!
{157097}{157142}I have nothing...
{157146}{157189}but you...
{157193}{157237}if you want that.
{157371}{157420}My God...
{157457}{157500}You lie so beautifully!
{157565}{157596}I never lie!
{157926}{157987}What are you doing, | my... friend?
{157990}{158036}Just talking.
{158039}{158071}Talking?
{158155}{158231}And you have to talk in the dark?
{158234}{158266}The noise disturbed us.
{158381}{158433}The noise disturbed you?
{158570}{158621}The party disturbs you?
{158739}{158799}- My son's wedding disturbs you? | - You misunderstood me!
{158803}{158876}I understood perfectly, believe me.
{158956}{158999}I have a headache.
{159003}{159039}How surprising!
{159275}{159321}Look at them.
{159399}{159426}Give it to me...
{159566}{159615}My friend...
{159634}{159710}let's break the tradition of a friend
{159713}{159771}killing his best friend.
{159774}{159813}Here's the gun...
{159856}{159884}Do the rest yourself!
{159941}{159993}- You know why? | - I know.
{160045}{160084}I think it's fair.
{160359}{160414}I'm a free woman!
{160868}{160944}A catastrophe!
{161176}{161225}Now we'll see | whose mother will mourn.
{161950}{161987}Dad!
{162918}{162950}Jovan, my son!
{163028}{163066}Get the weapons!
{163244}{163313}We're going!
{163359}{163383}Where to?
{163386}{163430}Outside, to end the war!
{164455}{164492}The Germans will kill us.
{164501}{164526}But, dad...
{164530}{164555}Stop daddying me!
{164558}{164586}Come on!
{164590}{164652}We're off to war, | not to a brothel!
{164655}{164713}The Germans will kill me!
{164717}{164758}Right!
{164762}{164834}Women and revolution | don't go together. Untie us!
{165019}{165108}Don't cry, Natalija. | We won't be parted long this time.
{165167}{165208}I'll wait for you!
{165326}{165371}I'll wait for you!
{165758}{165786}Soni!
{166853}{166885}Jovan, my son!
{166889}{166913}Dad!
{167231}{167273}Smell the Danube?
{167277}{167303}I don't.
{167307}{167381}You really get on my nerves... | Come on!
{167601}{167639}Dad!
{168168}{168208}- One question. | - What?
{168211}{168244}The colour...
{168282}{168323}You call this green?
{168326}{168359}Dark green.
{168362}{168389}You call this green?
{168392}{168435}Green!
{168439}{168489}Motherfuckers...
{168567}{168597}Fuckers!
{168601}{168641}He hates the colour.
{168680}{168749}Green!
{168752}{168799}Fuck your green!
{168803}{168839}Torturer!
{168843}{168881}Criminal!
{168897}{168953}The director | is waiting for you!
{168977}{169018}Keep on pissing...
{169022}{169058}Keep on pissing!
{169061}{169085}Not for long...
{169089}{169113}Not for long!
{169548}{169580}Hit out, son!
{169590}{169628}Not me, you moron!
{169753}{169814}You dare piss on my city?
{169818}{169854}- Dad's city! | - My city!
{170072}{170152}Shit! | 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12...
{170156}{170206}Madam, where's Jovan?
{170210}{170318}- They've gone outside. Someone fired. | - They'll betray us.
{170434}{170486}They won't be able to betray anyone.
{170524}{170549}They were killed.
{170774}{170862}Ringe ringe raja | Here comes Uncle Paja
{172655}{172732}We are at this historic spot
{172736}{172803}where in the year of 19...
{172976}{173090}cowardly criminals murdered | our National Hero,
{173093}{173132}Petar Popara Blacky.
{173419}{173484}Don't be afraid, my son! | Don't be afraid.
{173573}{173602}What was that, dad?
{173606}{173641}A pheasant.
{173681}{173711}Is it dangerous?
{173738}{173782}A pheasant? Dangerous?
{173786}{173830}It's like a wild hen!
{173937}{173983}There's the sun.
{174040}{174088}That's the moon, my boy.
{174118}{174154}The moon.
{174157}{174205}Where's the sun?
{174209}{174256}The sun is asleep.
{174260}{174291}It is resting.
{174607}{174632}Come on!
{174726}{174769}Keep down!
{175572}{175657}I'm just saying that you
{175660}{175771}look so much like Franzi, | and Franzi is short
{175774}{175841}for Franz.
{175845}{175899}Because "i" is the smallest letter.
{175903}{175930}Here we are!
{175934}{175981}Franz!
{176095}{176200}See that blond man, son? | That's Franz.
{176252}{176297}Look at him.
{176301}{176367}He hasn't changed in fifteen years.
{176441}{176504}That's Germans for you!
{176577}{176619}He tortured you.
{176646}{176695}And sent Natalija to a camp.
{176796}{176821}Perfect!
{176825}{176910}A disguise? | He thinks I won't recognize him.
{176945}{177005}What's the other one doing?
{177106}{177146}A collaborator!
{177263}{177312}Franz!
{177316}{177408}What's all this smoke? | Sabotage or what?
{177933}{178003}Let's make the execution | look as natural as possible.
{178047}{178078}What?
{178082}{178155}Dad, he looks like you!
{178159}{178216}- Who? | - That one!
{178219}{178257}The skinny one?
{178260}{178305}You really get on my nerves!
{178309}{178390}I could belt you at times. | You're just like your mother.
{178394}{178498}I don't believe it! | You ask me to act naturally!
{178501}{178588}- I didn't say that! | - Yes, you did. I'm not stupid.
{178591}{178647}You did say that.
{178651}{178675}Honestly...
{178780}{178853}Come on, don't be touchy!
{178857}{178947}Honestly, I don't know | what I'm supposed to do now!
{178951}{178999}Hold on!
{179003}{179040}Is this natural for you?
{179171}{179218}Honestly, man...
{179221}{179266}Come and shoot me!
{179270}{179308}That's it!
{179311}{179395}Here's the gun and the camera, | now shoot me!
{179398}{179489}The one like you | seems very brave.
{179492}{179552}All brave people look like me.
{179555}{179615}Are you soldiers | or ballerinas?
{179618}{179646}Look at you!
{179649}{179702}Come on, roll!
{179706}{179793}Where's the smoke? | Never there when it's needed!
{179892}{179968}Get away from me! Now!
{179971}{180091}Look what he's doing. | He'd stop at nothing!
{180095}{180169}That's true. But he's the best | I've ever worked with.
{180173}{180234}And I've worked with quite a few...
{180237}{180325}He gives us room to improvise.
{180329}{180427}Get lost! Get away from me! | I can't concentrate!
{180431}{180461}Tell her!
{180508}{180537}Get to your places.
{180541}{180615}"Spring Comes on a White Horse", | scene 32a, take one.
{180655}{180681}Action!
{180684}{180760}Get rid of that! Get rid of it!
{180764}{180842}I want to look death in the eye!
{180845}{180893}Would you like one last cigarette?
{181101}{181214}Long live the Communist Party | of Yugoslavia!
{181217}{181271}Take aim!
{181423}{181459}What happened?
{181489}{181530}That's it! Natural!
{181534}{181589}That's natural!
{181638}{181662}Go on!
{181665}{181754}What do you mean? | We never agreed on this!
{181757}{181821}Go on acting! | Don't interrupt the shot!
{181825}{181870}Act!
{181873}{181935}Call this directing? God!
{181939}{182062}Long live the Communist Party | of Yugoslavia!
{182066}{182133}Under the leadership | of Comrade Tito!
{182137}{182200}Fucking fascist motherfuckers!
{182295}{182399}Don't interrupt the sequence, | you idiots!
{182510}{182549}Throw it, son!
{182937}{182970}Charge!
{183105}{183154}Just like me!
{183158}{183182}Where's security?
{183923}{184036}Comrade, you want a ride | to West Germany?
{184167}{184200}I'm looking for
{184204}{184315}my monkey, Soni...
{184318}{184441}You haven't seen him by any chance, | have you?
{184444}{184510}You're looking for your monkey?
{184513}{184626}Yes, his name's Soni.
{185065}{185100}A horse!
{185181}{185250}Jovan, sunshine, that's a deer.
{185253}{185289}A deer?
{185311}{185352}That's how you drew horses.
{185356}{185394}It's a deer.
{185602}{185627}Jelena!
{185696}{185748}It can't be Jelena, sunshine.
{185752}{185816}Calm down, son, calm down!
{185820}{185852}What's that?
{185904}{185987}That's nothing. | Just a fish.
{185991}{186100}I fished 25-pounders right here | before the war.
{186131}{186175}God, I was really scared.
{186178}{186231}I was afraid for Jelena.
{186234}{186282}Don't be afraid, my boy.
{186411}{186469}I want to go back to the cellar.
{186936}{187009}Could anyone | start protecting us artists?
{187012}{187088}Could anyone look after us? | We work day and night
{187092}{187191}for our comrades! | And we go through hell!
{187195}{187230}Calm down.
{187233}{187275}What do you mean, calm down?
{187278}{187344}We could've been killed!
{187369}{187457}You do your job, | let me do mine.
{187460}{187515}I can't do my job!
{187519}{187579}You must protect | my set and my life!
{187582}{187696}My life was in danger here!
{187700}{187750}I'll tell you...
{187754}{187827}I didn't want to in front of him. | He's responsible.
{187831}{187873}- It's his fault. | - Whose?
{187877}{187937}The director's. | Shouting all the time:
{187940}{188018}"Be natural! The more natural, | the more terrifying."
{188022}{188102}And what happened? | He got his natural and terrifying.
{188156}{188244}Honestly...
{189358}{189432}How beautiful this world is!
{189436}{189472}Congratulations!
{190207}{190258}Careful, dad, you'll drown!
{190387}{190417}Come for a swim.
{190543}{190600}Come on, sunshine!
{190603}{190702}Come on in! | Do you hear me?
{190706}{190740}Jovan, my son!
{190789}{190832}Come on!
{190835}{190878}I can't swim, dad!
{192832}{192892}Don't be afraid, son.
{192896}{192924}Dad's here.
{192957}{193013}Come on, swim!
{193093}{193197}First your leg! | Then your arm!
{193200}{193318}First left! Then right!
{193381}{193466}- I'm swimming! | - Of course, I'm holding you.
{193470}{193508}Close your mouth!
{195482}{195545}Where is the kid now?
{195548}{195589}He really gets on my nerves!
{195996}{196043}Son!
{196921}{196971}There is no life for us | in this country.
{196987}{197024}No, my love...
{197438}{197555}We can't go on living...
{197559}{197617}with lunatics...
{197620}{197684}madmen...
{197688}{197741}psychopaths...
{197745}{197776}maniacs...
{197780}{197822}liars...
{197826}{197871}thieves...
{197875}{197905}criminals...
{197908}{197934}murderers...
{197937}{197965}Can we?
{197981}{198005}No, we can't.
{198077}{198102}We can't, my love.
{198209}{198234}There.
{198318}{198427}There's no place | for an honest man in this country.
{198430}{198466}No place at all.
{198485}{198511}Under the bearing wall!
{199982}{200024}Are you sure?
{200052}{200083}I'm sure.
{200712}{200790}Marko Dren's disappearance coincided
{200794}{200850}with the loss of the secret formula
{200854}{200902}of Tito's Yugoslavia.
{200905}{200960}Tito, having lost his friend,
{200964}{200999}fell ill.
{201002}{201062}Twenty years later, he died...
{204532}{204601}Part Three - The War
{204603}{204670}1992 - Berlin. | Ivan still hoped to see Soni...
{204793}{204822}Mircovic,
{204826}{204899}where did this marvel come from?
{204903}{204947}Officially, he's dead.
{204950}{205025}Dead? | On the contrary, he looks good.
{205028}{205071}You said officially?
{205075}{205115}The Yugoslav embassy says so.
{205142}{205270}A man bearing the same name | died in 1941
{205273}{205356}during the bombing of Belgrade.
{205359}{205434}He was the zoo-keeper.
{205437}{205482}Do you know if...
{205485}{205513}Look
{205517}{205553}what he drew for me.
{205557}{205606}If he was an Indian,
{205609}{205693}they'd call him | He Who Surrenders.
{205725}{205787}He told me unbelievable things.
{205790}{205816}He says
{205819}{205874}he lived the whole time in a cellar.
{205878}{205937}Communism was one big cellar.
{205940}{205980}The whole planet
{205984}{206012}is a cellar.
{206016}{206068}I'm going to Portugal this summer.
{206071}{206176}Perhaps he could show me | an underground motorway.
{206242}{206286}Happy New Year!
{206430}{206478}Happy New Year, lvan!
{206482}{206514}It isn't for me!
{206518}{206615}Why do you cry all the time?
{206619}{206707}I want to go home | to Yugoslavia!
{206710}{206791}There's a war over there. | A horrifying war!
{206795}{206830}I know.
{206834}{206881}Not the war you're thinking of.
{206885}{206981}In our country, | there's only our war.
{206985}{207070}World War II ended 50 years ago.
{207073}{207120}And the Germans won.
{207123}{207166}No, they didn't, they lost.
{207169}{207268}So why are they celebrating?
{207299}{207388}You're lying to me, doctor.
{207392}{207435}You work for the Germans.
{207439}{207490}You work for them, don't you?
{207494}{207559}Yes, I work for them | but not those Germans.
{207615}{207655}You're a traitor!
{207659}{207740}What am I? | A traitor?
{207836}{207882}I'll show who the traitor is!
{207886}{207964}I didn't want to show you this
{207967}{208041}but look for yourself.
{208044}{208136}Who's on these Interpol warrants? | Look.
{208139}{208179}Who?
{208183}{208279}My brother Marko and Natalija.
{208282}{208346}They're wanted by the police | throughout the world.
{208380}{208471}They killed some people in a cellar, traded | arms...
{208475}{208544}The crates were stamped | with a monkey.
{208547}{208589}Your Soni, maybe.
{208712}{208747}Where are you going?
{208751}{208776}lvan!
{208992}{209029}What's wrong?
{209033}{209125}He lied to me!
{209129}{209165}Who lied to you?
{209169}{209274}My own brother!
{209696}{209746}Don't do anything stupid!
{209749}{209798}lvan, we're not children! | Let's go back!
{209878}{209920}Come back!
{209981}{210029}Oh, fuck it!
{210127}{210164}Stop messing around!
{210167}{210202}Come back!
{210929}{210963}Wait for me!
{211134}{211175}I can't...
{211178}{211231}I can't go on!
{211235}{211264}I'll die!
{211301}{211326}Wait!
{212268}{212300}Stop, for God's sake!
{212303}{212352}Which way to Italy?
{212355}{212426}We don't know. We're lost too. | Where did you come from?
{212429}{212479}Bosnia. Where are you going?
{212483}{212553}To Yugoslavia.
{212556}{212585}No Yugoslavia!
{212589}{212673}What do you mean?
{212699}{212742}There's no more Yugoslavia!
{212746}{212770}Can we come?
{212773}{212866}Yes, if you pay DM 1,000. | They paid as well.
{212942}{213000}Ivan, wait!
{213080}{213121}Let's go to Italy!
{213124}{213170}We'll eat spaghetti!
{213173}{213256}We'll drink wine! | Let's go with these people!
{213259}{213369}What does he mean, | no Yugoslavia?
{213372}{213424}I've had enough, lvan.
{213427}{213503}I'm going to Italy | or to fucking hell!
{213516}{213576}I can't go on! | Take care.
{213579}{213624}Wait!
{213627}{213666}Wait for me!
{213772}{213834}Take care, lvan!
{215086}{215126}Where...
{215130}{215212}have you been?
{216120}{216160}Blood...
{216881}{216925}Has anyone seen my Jovan?
{216929}{216974}No.
{217038}{217087}Load!
{217268}{217293}Fire!
{217355}{217391}Nowhere to be found...
{217469}{217549}Fucking fascist motherfuckers!
{218252}{218364}I don't have time to bargain, | to haggle over percentages.
{218436}{218530}I've come here to help you, | independently
{218534}{218616}of our religious, national | and political differences.
{218620}{218699}But I ask only one thing of you: | please don't shout.
{218702}{218815}We'll reach an agreement | in a civilized, educated way.
{218966}{219024}You need me, | not the other way round.
{219076}{219117}Don't worry.
{219120}{219203}The Serbs kill the Croats | and the Croats kill the Serbs.
{219206}{219236}Don't be afraid.
{219240}{219283}You're too kind.
{219286}{219314}Don't mention it.
{219317}{219381}You're young, kid. | You don't understand.
{219385}{219523}I do, but you've been abroad too long. | You don't understand our language.
{219527}{219625}You're asking too much. | Understand? Too much.
{219628}{219696}I'm asking the minimum.
{219699}{219745}DM 3 per bullet?
{219748}{219773}Minimum!
{219777}{219801}$100 per grenade?
{219804}{219858}Buy from Hungarians, | you fucker!
{220656}{220712}lvan...
{220715}{220751}My brother!
{220821}{220863}What are you doing, lvan?
{220912}{220998}Have you gone mad? | It's a sin to kill your brother!
{221015}{221057}The greatest sin!
{221061}{221118}Don't, lvan!
{221161}{221247}Forgive me, lvan!
{221251}{221281}I saved your life three times.
{221432}{221486}I saved your life three times!
{221513}{221561}It hurts! lvan, don't!
{221570}{221613}Forgive me, lvan.
{221630}{221683}God sees everything, lvan.
{221737}{221779}God will punish you.
{221783}{221827}He'll punish you!
{222145}{222192}Lord, forgive me.
{223903}{223944}What are you doing?
{224491}{224516}My love...
{224623}{224700}"No war...
{224703}{224747}"is a war...
{224750}{224809}"until a brother...
{224813}{224852}"kills his brother."
{225031}{225105}My love!
{225382}{225451}Come on, you old hag!
{225480}{225540}Young man, this is my husband.
{225543}{225585}Move when I tell you to!
{225598}{225668}What are you waiting for? | Get down!
{225839}{225938}Comrade Commander, we've captured | 16 Chetniks, 30 Ustashas
{225941}{225992}and 3 UN men.
{225995}{226118}Plus two war profiteers | with a Mercedes.
{226121}{226166}What do we do with them?
{226169}{226228}Profiteers...
{226256}{226296}Execute them on the spot!
{227374}{227469}Comrade Blacky! | Pockets searched, soldiers disarmed.
{227473}{227564}The profiteers' passports... | What do I do with all these people?
{227567}{227601}Take them to the well.
{227605}{227632}Any sign of Jovan?
{227635}{227662}No.
{227665}{227708}No...
{227734}{227777}I protest, sir!
{227781}{227820}Me too, comrade!
{227824}{227863}I'm no "comrade", sir.
{227867}{227916}And I'm no "sir", comrade.
{227919}{227987}What are you? | Ustasha, Chetnik, partisan?
{227991}{228062}I'm Petar Popara Blacky.
{228066}{228115}Which army are you in, comrade?
{228118}{228147}My own!
{228151}{228209}Do you have a superior?
{228213}{228281}Yes, my country!
{228284}{228328}Fucking fascist motherfucker!
{228605}{228661}Marko, my brother!
{228665}{228713}Natalija...
{228717}{228759}my love!
{229034}{229081}I can't find Jovan.
{231210}{231253}See, my dear monkey.
{231295}{231332}Who would have thought it?
{231349}{231381}Nobody.
{231458}{231577}Imagine that you have a son,
{231580}{231612}a baby monkey.
{231642}{231685}And someone hides him from you...
{231726}{231776}And you search for him for years...
{231780}{231881}But you can't find him anywhere.
{231885}{231968}Say, isn't that sad?
{232072}{232136}And what a son I had!
{232140}{232186}Do you remember my Jovan?
{232210}{232247}What was he like?
{232302}{232342}A strong lad.
{232346}{232391}Just like me!
{232476}{232542}There is no more sun
{232567}{232672}There is no more moon...
{232778}{232810}Did you hear that?
{232813}{232839}Did you hear?
{232861}{232918}Jovan!
{232922}{232958}My son!
{233303}{233343}Light of my life!
{236109}{236161}Jovan, my son!
{236182}{236235}I knew I'd find you! I knew it!
{236264}{236299}Who organized this?
{236302}{236327}Mum did.
{236399}{236426}Here's to you!
{236579}{236609}My friend!
{236613}{236683}Did she really have to come?
{236686}{236758}She's my friend's wife! | Are you crazy?
{236761}{236803}I know what's what.
{236806}{236832}What do you know?
{236835}{236883}I'm not stupid.
{236886}{236915}They're married!
{237200}{237248}My friend!
{237252}{237307}Natalija is a little embarrassed.
{237816}{237853}Let me introduce you.
{237856}{237884}Meet my friend's wife!
{237892}{237936}Pleased to meet you.
{238050}{238082}Play louder!
{238086}{238137}That's it, Vera!
{238594}{238638}Let bygones be bygones.
{238801}{238849}He's grown so fast. | Look at him.
{238852}{238892}Big guy, isn't he?
{238956}{239017}Fifteen years, Vera.
{239020}{239072}What do you mean, fifteen? | Twenty!
{239076}{239103}No, fifteen.
{239107}{239138}- Twenty! | - Fifteen!
{239142}{239168}Twenty!
{239171}{239224}I know my own son's age!
{239273}{239320}My sunshine!
{239364}{239396}Sister!
{239400}{239468}Bato! My sweet brother!
{239471}{239531}You're dancing!
{239535}{239591}Marko, look, he's dancing!
{239594}{239630}Look, Marko!
{239633}{239669}Let's dance together!
{239858}{239891}Forgive me?
{239894}{239968}I can forgive | but I cannot forget.
{240106}{240172}Here we built new houses
{240175}{240263}with red roofs | and chimneys where storks will nest.
{240266}{240341}With wide-open doors | for dear guests.
{240344}{240459}We'll thank the soil for feeding us | and the sun for warming us.
{240462}{240549}And the fields for reminding us | of the green grass of home.
{240553}{240677}With pain, sorrow and joy, | we shall remember our country,
{240680}{240783}as we tell our children | stories that start like fairytales:
{240786}{240857}Once upon a time, | there was a country...
{241971}{242085}This story has no end...
